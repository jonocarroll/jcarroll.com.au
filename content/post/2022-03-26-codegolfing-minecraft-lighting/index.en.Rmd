I occasionally like to participate in an odd sport known as 'code golf' where the aim is to write some code to achieve a given task using the smallest number of characters.

R isn't optimised for this in the slightest (why would it be?) and there are other languages which have expanded character sets which are, e.g. [BQL](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/), [MATL](https://github.com/lmendo/MATL), and [05AB1E](https://github.com/Adriandmen/05AB1E).

These are typically short, contained problems which can be solved in a variety of ways, so they usually include some restrictions and test cases. Some are more amenable to using R, while others have better support in other languages.

[This one](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/245451/recreate-minecrafts-lighting) caught my eye, partly because my kids are obsessed with Minecraft. The problem as stated:

> Minecraft has a fairly unique lighting system. Each block's light value is either one less than the brightest one surrounding it, or it is a light source itself. Your task is to write a method that takes in a 2D array of light source values, and then returns a 2D array with spread out lighting, where 0 is the minimum value.

```
Input1 = [
         [0, 0, 4, 0], 
         [0, 0, 0, 0], 
         [0, 2, 0, 0], 
         [0, 0, 0, 0]
        ]

Output1 = [
         [2, 3, 4, 3], 
         [1, 2, 3, 2], 
         [1, 2, 2, 1], 
         [0, 1, 1, 0]
        ]

Input2 = [
         [2, 0, 0, 3], 
         [0, 0, 0, 0], 
         [0, 0, 0, 0], 
         [0, 0, 0, 0]
        ]

Output2 = [
         [2, 1, 2, 3], 
         [1, 0, 1, 2], 
         [0, 0, 0, 1], 
         [0, 0, 0, 0]
        ]
```

Matrix operations? That sounds like something R can work with. I decided to have a go. There were already some answers using the golfing languages, and I can't even read those, so those aren't any help. There was at least one python answer, but I didn't want to confuse myself trying to translate an existing answer when the tooling doesn't quite work that way.

Defining the input matrices is straightforward enough
```{r}
mtest1 <- matrix(c(0, 0, 4, 0,
                   0, 0, 0, 0,
                   0, 2, 0, 0,
                   0, 0, 0, 0), 4, 4, byrow = TRUE)
mtest1

mtest2 <- matrix(c(2, 0, 0, 3,
                   0, 0, 0, 0,
                   0, 0, 0, 0,
                   0, 0, 0, 0), 4, 4, byrow = TRUE)
mtest2
```
but do remember to set `byrow = TRUE` if you're writing your matrix out ... by rows.

I needed a way to identify the locations and values of these light sources. I know that `which()` can return array indices with `arr.ind = TRUE` so I tried that
```{r}
which(mtest1 > 0, arr.ind = TRUE)
```
I'll also need the values at those sources
```{r}
mtest1[mtest1 > 0]
```
So far, so good. Now, I'll need to spread 'light' out from each of those sources. That seems... trickier.

A few options came to mind, including a convolution operation, but I couldn't get that to work. I eventually ended up writing a loop to set decreasing values along the row and column of each light source, forwards and backwards.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (r in seq_along(y)) {
    q <- p <- y[[r]]
    q <- rbind(q, data.frame(l=p$l-seq_along(p$c:n)+1, r=p$r, c=p$c:n))
    q <- rbind(q, data.frame(l=p$l-seq_along(p$c:1)+1, r=p$r, c=p$c:1))
    q <- rbind(q, data.frame(l=p$l-seq_along(p$r:n)+1, r=p$r:n, c=p$c))
    q <- rbind(q, data.frame(l=p$l-seq_along(p$r:1)+1, r=p$r:1, c=p$c))
}
```
This involved creating a `data.frame` of row and column values, plus the value of the light at that position. This isn't efficient at all, and not just from the processing side - it uses a lot of characters. 

One way to get around this in codegolf is to use a short alias to a longer named function, e.g. `d = data.frame`, `b = rbind`. This saves a lot of characters.

The idea of creating indices at which to set values comes from the fact that a matrix can be subset by another matrix that specifies the rows and columns. i.e.
```{r}
## create a matrix
m = matrix(1:9, 3, 3, byrow = TRUE)
m

## specify the extraction of the elements as (1, 2) and (3, 2)
msub = matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 2), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)
msub

m[msub]
```
This can essentially 'un-`which()`' a matrix.

Once I had the reduced values in each direction away from a light source, for each light source, the last step was to combine these and take the maximum value at each element. `Reduce()` does this nicely with the function `pmax()` (parallel maximum which works across multiple vectors rather than the global maximum). 

Lastly, a second pass using all these new points as light sources ensures that the 'light' is propagated in all directions.

The solution, as I had it, worked and produced the test case results, but it was not yet golfed.

To "golf" some R code there's some optimisations we can make.

* Delete spaces where possible
* Use `=` over `<-` to save a character each time
* For R>=4.1, use the shorthand syntax for `function()`
```{r}
f=\(x)x^2
f(3)
```
* use `T` and `F` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` - generally inadvisable in regular code, but here they save some characters.
* use partial argument matching where possible - it's a dangerous feature of the language, but you only "need" to use as many letters of a function argument so that it's uniquely specified, so
```{r}
which(mtest1>0, arr.ind = TRUE)
```
can be shortened to
```{r}
which(mtest1>0,a=T)
```
* Create aliases to functions - just remember to alias the *name* of the function, not the call (with parentheses)
```{r}
d=determinant.matrix
identical(
  d(mtest1),
  determinant.matrix(mtest1)
)
```
* Use the prefix notation version of functions which require many characters, e.g. `if`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (3 > 2) {
  "res1"
} else {
  "res2"
}
```
vs
```{r, eval = FALSE}
`if`(3>2,"res1","res2")
```
keeping in mind that `ifelse()` requires the same structure in both returned results (and it evaluates both), which tripped me up
```{r}
ifelse(TRUE, 1:4, 2)
```

With all those in place, I landed at 377 characters for my solution. Certainly not great, considering the python answer was ~200.

I really wanted a better way to "spread" the light out from a single point, but I wasn't finding any nice solutions to that simpler sub-problem. A great way to get a solution is to ask other people, so I wrote a short post on [my new mini blog](https://jcarroll.xyz/2022/03/25/r-challenge-contour.html) asking the simpler question of how to achieve this. That cross-posts to Twitter, where [June Choe](https://twitter.com/yjunechoe/status/1507344665514848258?s=20&t=27rn8zNl-36D-3ppsslAjw) provided a great `outer()` solution. I'd tried something like that but not so cleverly. 
```{r}
vx <- 4
vy <- 3
vv <- 5
n <- 8
outer(1:n, 1:n, function(x, y) pmax(vv - abs(x - vx) - abs(y - vy), 0))
```
This greatly improves R's chances at solving this efficiently because now we can condense all the 'spread light' stuff into this one function, and because it's not iterative, we can `lapply()` over the results.

The "final" version, after some more clean up, is [an okay 182 characters](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/245581/26763)
```{r}
ls=\(m,w=T) {
  n=ncol(m)
  p=m>1
  i=which(p,a=T)
  y=lapply(1:nrow(i),\(j)outer(1:n,1:n,\(x,y)pmax(m[p][j]-abs(x-i[j,1])-abs(y-i[j,2]),0)))
  z=Reduce(pmax,y)
  `if`(w,ls(z,F),z)
}

ls(mtest1)
ls(mtest2)
```
I'm still of course interested if there are more optimisations to be made, so do let me know if you can spot any!
