When things run slower than we'd like in R we tend to reach for another, usually
compiled, language, and move our code there. What if it "just happened"? What
started out as a silly exploration of how to count digits ended up with a race
to see which language does it fastest. Maybe some surprises here for some, maybe
some bad implementations on my part - let's find out.

When things run slower than we'd like in R we tend to reach for another, usually
compiled, language, and move our code there. What if it "just happened"? What
started out as a silly exploration of how to count digits ended up with a race
to see which language does it fastest. Maybe some surprises here for some, maybe
some bad implementations on my part - let's find out.

I saw some recent activity on [{quickr}](https://github.com/t-kalinowski/quickr); 
Tomasz Kalinowski's R to Fortran transpiler - I had starred the repo a long time 
ago (and in haste, accidentally unstarred it, then re-starred it) but never 
really played with it. I'm familiar with slightly older Fortran; nowadays it's 
called "modern Fortran", but I did my PhD using Fortran95 in the late 2000's. 
I've even pushed some of my [postdoc code to GitHub](https://github.com/jonocarroll/Dirac) 
after getting it working again for a recent student.

I figured now was a great chance to have a proper play with the package. 

{quickr} "transpiles" R code which means it takes R code converts the syntax
into Fortran syntax using the same variables and equivalent functions where
available. The idea being that when R isn't working fast enough for you, instead
of re-writing your function in something like C++ (via {Rcpp}) it can
automatically write a Fortran version of your code and compile that into a
highly performant function which can be called with the same arguments. Faster
running code with no additional effort - sounds great!

The README for {quickr} has some examples highlighting how it can improve the 
performance of some functions beyond what {Rcpp} can offer, in some cases 
approaching C speeds. That's not surprising to those who know Fortran - it's 
still very much used in theoretical physics partly because of the performance, 
partly due to the existing support in that field, but also partly because despite 
being an 'old' language, it's actually pretty nice to use. 

One of the big advantages of Fortran I found when learning other languages
_after_ learning Fortran was that there's no manual memory management. If you
want a vector or an array/tensor with many dimensions, you just ask for it
(specifying a size along each dimension or dynamically sizing, but never
manually freeing memory). R is known for its statistics chops, but under the
hood of some of these functions still [call out to Fortran code](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Awch%2Fr-source+%22.Fortran%28%22+path%3A*.R&type=code).

I wanted some example code to try out myself and see if I even recognise the 
Fortran it produces. I didn't just want to use the example code from the package, 
so what could I use? 

In [this post](https://jcarroll.com.au/2025/05/03/rotation-with-modulo/) I 
celebrated the fact that Julia has a `ndigits()` function, while in R I cheated 
and used `nchar()` which works fine provided you're dealing with non-negative 
integers up to 99999, outside of which it doesn't do what you want

```{r}
nchar(99)       # 99    = 2 characters
nchar(99999)    # 99999 = 5 characters
nchar(99999+1)  # 1e+05 = 5 characters
nchar(-99)      # -99   = 3 characters
```

I had some interesting [discussions on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jonocarroll/114441466559717402) 
about different ways to implement `ndigits()` properly for R and in the end, 
re-implementing the Julia solution seemed to work great for all edge cases. I 
decided to use this for my Fortran testing with {quickr}.

I got the package installed and the compiler hooked up correctly so that I could 
run the example code, then tried adapting it to the `ndigits()` problem.

## R

The R code I started with was

```{r}
nd_R <- function(x) {
  out <- integer(length(x))
  x <- abs(x / 10)
  for (v in seq_along(x)) {
    d <- 1
    m <- 1
    while (m <= x[v]) {
      m <- m * 10
      d <- d + 1
    }
    out[v] <- d
  }
  out
}

nd_R(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))
```

and while this looks like a moderate amount of code, in essence it's taking the
absolute value of the input (since we want to ignore negatives, and which is
nicely vectorised in R), dividing by 10, checking if we've exceeded the input
yet, and if not, stepping through successive multiples of 10 until we do, which
finds the first power of 10 that is greater than our value, indicating the
number of digits. For what it's worth, this is why in that post I noted an
alternative route to achieving this; `ceil(log10(x))`.

## Fortran

Hoping to immediately transpile this to Fortran, ~~I immediately hit my first
snag; {quickr} hasn't yet implemented `while()` so I can't transpile this
exactly as I have it. There's no early `return()` or `break` either, so I can't
just exit an oversized loop early. Without an alternative, I'm going to cheat a
bit and just run a loop 12 times - this puts an upper limit on the input to a 12
digit number, but I can live with that.~~

Update _while writing the post_: I suppose good things come to those who wait - 
on digging through some source code for this post I saw that `while` has been 
implemented in the last week, so I'm going to pretend that was always the case.

The other piece this transpiler needs is a type declaration for the input; R 
is fully dynamic in that a function can take any type of object and it's up to 
the function to decide what to do with it. Fortran is a bit stricter, and 
requires types to be annotated, so I need to add a `declare(type())` to the code.

```{r}
nd2f <- function(x) {
  declare(
    type(x = integer(NA))
  )
  out <- integer(length(x))
  x <- abs(x / 10L)
  for (v in seq_along(out)) {
    d <- 1L
    m <- 1L
    while (m <= x[v]) {
      m <- m * 10L
      d <- d + 1L
    }
    out[v] <- d
  }
  out
}
```

NOTE: the original version of this post used `double()` values but as
[@toddixd](https://mastodon.social/@toddixd) noted, there's an additional
performance improvement to be made if we restrict to integers, which the values
will actually be.

Note that this is still very much R code at this point - I can even run it
in R and get the same answers as before

```{r}
nd2f(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))
```

What surprised me here is that `declare()` is a base R function (not from
{quickr}) intended for "specifying information about R code for use by the
interpreter, compiler, and code analysis tools". I was originally thinking it 
would be neat to be able to leverage that for some type-checking on the R side 
as well as being informative to the Fortran code, but it "ignores the arguments
and returns `NULL` invisibly", so no go on this throwing an error from R

```{r}
int_id <- function(x) {
  declare(type(x = integer(NA)))
  x
}

int_id(3L)
int_id(1.5)
```

The magic happens when we ask {quickr} to do the transpilation. 

The type information is used in the Fortran code, so compiling the `id()` example 
produces something that is more restrictive on types

```{r, error = TRUE}
int_id_F <- quickr::quick(int_id)
int_id_F(3L)
int_id_F(1.5)
```

I can inspect the generated code with `r2f()`, though one wouldn't normally need
to - it's interesting to see what the Fortran code looks like

```{r}
quickr:::r2f(int_id)
```

But of course, this just returns the value and that's not particularly
enlightening. Doing the same for the `ndigits` code

```{r}
quickr:::r2f(nd2f)
```

The subroutine itself looks a lot like the R code; sure, some type annotations
are sprinkled around, `do v = 1, size(x)` replaces `for v in seq_along(x)` and
`do while` replaces `while`, but I don't think it's entirely alien.

What might surprise some is the line

```fortran
x = abs((x / 10.0_c_double))
```

Notice there's no loop around this? Fortran is an array language...
Rank-polymorphism, baby! I covered this in 
[another post of mine](https://jcarroll.com.au/2023/08/29/now-you-re-thinking-with-arrays/) 
but thanks to this, `abs()` is vectorised wherever needed

```
program test_abs
  implicit none
  integer, dimension(5) :: i = [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
  write(*,*) abs(i)
end program test_abs
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
#           1           2           3           4           5
```

Generating the compiled Fortran code from `nd2f` is as easy as

```{r}
nd_F <- quickr::quick(nd2f)
nd_F
```

and we see that it's referencing some external code. This can be called

```{r}
nd_F(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))
```

with the big benefit that now it's a LOT faster! 

Generating a million random values and excluding any zero values, we can see the
50x performance increase (!!!)

```{r}
set.seed(1)
nums <- as.integer(runif(1e6, -1, 1) * 1e6)
nums <- nums[nums != 0]

b0 <- bench::mark(
  R = nd_R(nums),
  Fortran = nd_F(nums),
  min_iterations = 10
)

dplyr::arrange(b0[, 1:8], median)
plot(b0)
```

For those not familiar, this benchmark plot shows the individual times taken for 
repeated executions of the code in each 'expression', grouped vertically by the 
'expression' itself (annotated as the language here) with some random scatter to show 
the spread of execution times. Points to the left are faster. It's also worth 
noting that `bench::mark()` defaults to `check = TRUE` so we can rest assured that 
the results from each of the different languages we're about to explore are 
consistent and it's not some artifact of one language doing less work.

If you run these yourself you'll get slightly different results. I'm running them 
on a newish M3 Macbook Pro.

All that performance increase from just adding one line to the R code and
wrapping it with one other function (resulting in an entirely different program
being written and compiled, producing the correct results).

I should note that in the first iteration of this post (in which `while` was not yet
supported) I used an excessive `for` loop which resulted in a
not-as-impressive-but-still-very-impressive 15x performance boost. 

## R (compiled)

If compiled code is so great, what about just compiling the R code with, e.g.
`compiler::cmpfun()`?

```{r}
nd_comp = compiler::cmpfun(nd_R)

nd_comp(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))

b1 <- bench::mark(
  compiled = nd_comp(nums),
  R = nd_R(nums),
  Fortran = nd_F(nums),
  min_iterations = 10
)

dplyr::arrange(b1[, 1:8], median)
plot(b1)
```

That doesn't help; by the time the benchmark was running the `nd_R` function had
been called enough times for it to be JIT compiled, anyway.

This did get me thinking, though - what about other compiled alternatives?

## C

Since I'm going through Harvard's [CS50 'Introduction to Computer Science' course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/)
with [R Contributors](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/c-study-group-2025/)
to learn a bit more structured C I figured I'd add that via coolbutuseless'
[{callme}](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/callme) package. This surely isn't
the world's greatest C code, but it compiles and runs...

```{r}
callme::compile(
  "
#include <R.h>
#include <Rinternals.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

SEXP nd_C(SEXP vec) {
  int *vec_ptr = INTEGER(vec);
  SEXP res = PROTECT(allocVector(INTSXP, length(vec)));
  int *res_ptr = INTEGER(res);
  for (int i = 0; i < length(vec); i++) {
    int abs_x = abs(vec_ptr[i] / 10.0);
        int d = 1;
        int m = 1.0;
        while (m <= abs_x) {
            m *= 10.0;
            d++;
        }
        res_ptr[i] = d;
  }

  UNPROTECT(1);
  return res;
}
"
)

nd_C(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))
```

So, how does it compare?

```{r}
b2 <- bench::mark(
  C = nd_C(nums),
  R = nd_R(nums),
  Fortran = nd_F(nums),
  min_iterations = 10
)

dplyr::arrange(b2[, 1:8], median)
plot(b2)
```

Whoa - automatically transpiled Fortran runs faster than (my) C... That's fast.

## C++

What about C++ via {Rcpp}? Dealing with vectors is made easier by {Rcpp} having 
pre-built types compatible with R, and this otherwise looks very similar to the 
R code

```{r}
Sys.setenv("PKG_CXXFLAGS" = "-O3")
nd_Rcpp <- Rcpp::cppFunction(
  "
IntegerVector nd(const IntegerVector& x) {
    int n = x.size();
    IntegerVector out(n);

    for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
        int abs_x = std::abs(x[v] / 10);
        int d = 1;
        int m = 1;
        while (m <= abs_x) {
            m *= 10;
            d++;
        }
        out[v] = d;
    }

    return out;
}
"
)

nd_Rcpp(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))

b3 <- bench::mark(
  `C++` = nd_Rcpp(nums),
  C = nd_C(nums),
  R = nd_R(nums),
  Fortran = nd_F(nums),
  min_iterations = 10
)

dplyr::arrange(b3[, 1:8], median)
plot(b3)
```

This one seems to wander around a bit; on different runs I've seen performance
equal or better to the C code and on others, about 3x as long, but generally
pretty fast.

## Julia

After all of this, I remembered that I was comparing the Julia implementation -
how does _that_ perform? Julia is a JIT/AOT compiled language, so maybe it's not
too bad... I can still call that directly from R

```{r}
JuliaCall::julia_eval("ndigits.([123456, 234, -72])")
```

keeping in mind that the Julia function `ndigits` ([the implementation for which](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/760b2e5b7396f9cc0da5efce0cadd5d1974c4069/base/intfuncs.jl#L633)
I've borrowed for all of the examples, so we _are_ dealing with the same
algorithm in each case) is in fact compiled, but available as `ndigits()`. As
long as I make the vector available in a Julia session (as integers; the
function is only defined for integers) I can run this

```{r}
JuliaCall::julia_assign("nums", nums)

b4 <- bench::mark(
  Julia = JuliaCall::julia_eval("ndigits.(nums)"),
  `C++` = nd_Rcpp(nums),
  C = nd_C(nums),
  R = nd_R(nums),
  Fortran = nd_F(nums),
  min_iterations = 10
)

dplyr::arrange(b4[, 1:8], median)
plot(b4)
```

Ten points to Julia - remember, this is an interpreted language.

![That's really fast!](images/vince2.jpg){width=400px}

I should note there's work being done towards [making Julia binaries out of scripts](https://jbytecode.github.io/juliac/), but this still has a startup time 
of a few dozen milliseconds for even a Hello, World example.

## Rust

One more? What about Rust? We can use {rextendr} to call Rust code inline,
making sure to target the release profile for maximum performance

```{r}
rextendr::rust_function(
  r"(
  fn nd_Rust(x: &[i32]) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut out = vec![0; x.len()];
    for v in 0..x.len() {
        let abs_x = (x[v].abs() / 10);
        let mut d = 1;
        let mut m = 1;
        while m <= abs_x {
            m *= 10;
            d += 1;
        }
        out[v] = d;
    }
    out
  }
)",
  profile = "release"
)

nd_Rust(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))

b5 <- bench::mark(
  Rust = nd_Rust(nums),
  Julia = JuliaCall::julia_eval("ndigits.(nums)"),
  `C++` = nd_Rcpp(nums),
  C = nd_C(nums),
  R = nd_R(nums),
  Fortran = nd_F(nums),
  min_iterations = 10
)

dplyr::arrange(b5[, 1:8], median)
plot(b5)
```

![Ridiculous speeds!](images/vince3.jpg){width=400px}

We are truly spoiled for choice these days - not only do we have a plethora of
languages we can call directly from R, but several languages which run faster than
even (at least my implementation of) C and count number of digits of
a million values in under 4ms.

After enforcing integers in the R code which was transpiled to Fortran, we've 
somehow managed to achieve Rust speeds with nearly 0 additional effort. I'm 
very impressed!

## Python

Just for funsies, what about Python? It's not a compiled language, but maybe if
I use numpy it will be fast ... ? It's at least another language I can call from
R that is generally considered 'faster'. Is it?

```{r}
library(reticulate)
reticulate::py_run_string('
import numpy as np
def nd_python(x):
    x = np.asarray(x)
    out = np.zeros(len(x), dtype=int)

    for v in range(len(x)):
        abs_x = abs(x[v] / 10)
        d = 1
        m = 1
        while m <= abs_x:
            m *= 10
            d += 1
        out[v] = d

    return out.tolist()
')

py$nd_python(c(123456L, 234L, -72L))

b6 <- bench::mark(
  Python = py$nd_python(nums),
  Rust = nd_Rust(nums),
  Julia = JuliaCall::julia_eval("ndigits.(nums)"),
  `C++` = nd_Rcpp(nums),
  C = nd_C(nums),
  R = nd_R(nums),
  Fortran = nd_F(nums),
  min_iterations = 10
)

dplyr::arrange(b6[, 1:8], median)
plot(b6)
```

In fairness, there's overhead here involved with calling it from R, but I think
that's apples-to-apples considering I'm doing the same with all the compiled
languages.

## Does it scale?

I've been running these benchmarks for a million numbers, but how do the results
scale with that size? What if it's just a handful of numbers? What about in
between these extremes? Running the benchmarks at various scales should show this.

```{r}
n_vals <- 10^(1:7)
scales <- purrr::map_df(n_vals, ~{
  set.seed(1)
  nums <- as.integer(runif(.x, -1, 1) * .x)
  nums <- nums[nums != 0]
  JuliaCall::julia_assign("nums", nums)
  b <- bench::mark(
    Python = py$nd_python(nums),
    Rust = nd_Rust(nums),
    Julia = JuliaCall::julia_eval("ndigits.(nums)"),
    `C++` = nd_Rcpp(nums),
    C = nd_C(nums),
    R = nd_R(nums),
    Fortran = nd_F(nums),
    min_iterations = 10,
    check = TRUE
  )
  dplyr::bind_cols(vec_len = .x, b[, 1:8])
})

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(scales,
       aes(x = vec_len,
           y = 1e6*as.numeric(median),
           col = as.character(expression)
       )) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_color_discrete(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(
    title = "Scaling of Counting ndigits Benchmarks",
    x = "Vector Length",
    y = "Microseconds",
    color = "Language"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

What a nice, log-log linear result with that one exception - Julia is pretty
constant up until 1000, after which it starts to follow the same trajectory as
the other languages - presumably that's just the overhead of starting up the
Julia runtime, which is a known bottleneck.

There's definitely a clear divide between the interpreted languages (R and Python)
and the compiled ones.

At lower vector lengths there's a little bit of a spread with Fortran really showing
off at the lowest lengths

```{r}
dplyr::arrange(scales[scales$vec_len == 10, ], median)
```

but we're looking at sub microsecond differences - what _will_ you do with all
that free time?

By the time we're looking at 1000 values, the compiled languages are all about
the same

```{r}
dplyr::arrange(scales[scales$vec_len == 1000, ], median)
```

At ten million values it's a complete wash the compiled languages with maybe a 
slight drop for C

```{r}
dplyr::arrange(scales[scales$vec_len == 1e7, ], median)
```

All very interesting!

It would probably be worthwhile digging into the memory usage of all of these
since there's a big difference that likely indicates something different is
happening, but that's beyond my understanding - feel free to let me know!

So, what might be the reason for Rust and Julia to be so fast, even compared to
C? These are newer languages with a lot of focus on their compilers, and it's
entirely possible that they're able to make some better optimisations compared
to a very general C compiler, but more likely that's the upper limit of what a
computer can do in that much time and my C code is non-optimal.

## Conclusions

Back to the original point, though - the transpilation does an amazing job
of improving the code _without having to write more code in a different
language_. Sure, Julia solves this 'two language problem' by just being
ridiculously fast to begin with, but if I _am_ writing R code, it's fantastic to
see there's an option for just "making it go brrr" without actually doing
anything extra.

Not all of R has been translated to Fortran so there's a lot of code that won't
transpile just yet, but it's a truly inspiring project that I'll surely be
keeping a close eye on.

I'd love to hear what people think about these comparisons - are there points I've
overlooked? Better ways to do it? Improvements to my implementations which change
the results? Other considerations I've missed? As always, I can be found on
