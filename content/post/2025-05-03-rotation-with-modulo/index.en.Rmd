and my first thought was "ooh, that's cool", but my second thought was "I'm 
going to implement this in a bunch of languages!". Sure, it's a very small bit 
of math to implement without any particular sharp edges of iteration/recursion, 
but that means I'll be working with some basic functionality and I believe it's 
very important to have that locked in comfortably. Let's see how it goes!

I'm not aware of a "name" for this as such. Writing it out a little more styled

$$
rot(n, j, k) = (n\times10^k)\ \%\ (10^j-1)
$$

it looks like I'll just need a 'power' and a 'modulo'. The $j$ there is the 
number of digits in $n$ and sure, we could count that ourselves and pass it as 
an argument, but even better might be to calculate it as well. That means 
figuring out how many digits are in a number. 

As always, my go-to is R, so let's start there.

## R

In R the power operator is `^`. Also `**`, but that's almost never used - 
there's even a note about that in the documentation

> `**` is translated in the parser to `^`, but this was undocumented for many years.

Modulo is `%%` which I can _never_ remember because it's similar to integer 
division which is `%/%`.

To get the number of digits we can use the fact that `nchar()` will first convert
its input into a character vector, so `12345` becomes `"12345"` and thus the 
number of characters of that is the number of digits. If that wasn't the case 
I could still do 

```{r}
ceiling(log10(314159))
```

but the `nchar()` approach seems fine. Putting those pieces together into a 
function which takes the number and how many places to move it, I get

```{r}
rot <- function(n, k) {
  (n*10^k) %% (10^nchar(n)-1)
}
rot(12345, 3)
```

You can see that the values are 'rotated' cyclically by 3 places. 

R doesn't have a built-in way to achieve this even for a vector of values
(rotating 'digits' of an integer is a toy problem that is unlikely to actually
come up in real situations). One solution is my
[{vec}](https://github.com/jonocarroll/vec) package which does implement a
ring-buffer sort of effect for vectors

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("jonocarroll/vec")
library(vec)
v <- as_vec(1:5)
rotate(v, 3)
```

Under the hood this uses modulo on the _indices_

```{r}
x <- 1:5; n <- 3
x[(((n - 1 + seq_along(x)) %% length(x))) + 1]
```

One extra feature of this is it also takes negative values to shift the other way 

```{r}
rotate(v, -3)
```

whereas the `rot()` implementation above can't.

## Julia

As is almost always the case, the Julia functionality looks closer to what one 
might "expect" from translating maths or stats; the power operator remains `^`, 
but the modulo operator is a more familiar `%`. There is an actual `ndigits()` 
function to get the number of digits which, as far as I can tell from the source,
doesn't first convert to character. The examples for that function do highlight 
a failing of the R approach - if a value is negative then `as.character()` will 
produce the wrong number of digits. In R:

```{r}
as.character(-1234)
nchar(-1234)
```

while in Julia

```{julia}
ndigits(-1234)
```

We're not dealing with negatives here, but that's certainly a gotcha.

Implementing the Julia function can be done in a single line so no need for a 
`function` keyword

```{julia}
rot(n,k) = (n*10^k) % (10^ndigits(n)-1)
rot(12345, 3)
```

If we _were_ working with vectors, Julia also has a built-in way to do the 
cyclic rotation, though it seems to shift in the opposite direction

```{julia}
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
circshift(x, -3)
circshift(x, 3)
```

Here ends the Algol-language portion of the post, and I'll move on to some 
languages where these operations are even more fundamental...

## APL

When I see 'straightforward' math operations on numbers I now think APL because 
that's what it was originally built for and it works so very well; each math 
operation you could perform on an array of values has a 'glyph' representing it 
so should be a better 'translation' of the math on a blackboard directly to code.

One thing R users will immediately recognise is the assignment glyph `←`; yes 
that's a single glyph, not R's `<-`, but it works the same as in R.

You're probably familiar with the multiplication glyph `×` and addition `+`. 
The power/exponentiation glyph is `*`. Nothing too surprising there, I hope.

Because `-` is the 'subtract' operation, there's a distinct glyph for 'negative' 
`¯` (a raised hyphen) so it isn't confused with subtraction. Modulo takes some 
more inspiration from math and is `|`. The only other potentially confusing 
glyphs are length `≢` and format `⍕` which, when combined, do something very 
similar to R's "how many characters does this use?". Again the 'negative number' 
problem is here, but we're not worried about that in this case.

Putting those pieces together requires knowing that APL evaluates right-to-left, 
with the argument to the right of an operator in a "function" being denoted by 
omega (`⍵`) and the one to the left being alpha (`⍺`). The function I came up 
with looks like this

```apl
    rot←{(¯1+10*≢⍕⍵)|⍵×10*⍺}
```

It's entirely possible that it can be shortened or improved; I have a tendency 
to overlook where parentheses are really required and opportunities for 
simplification. Nonetheless, if you read from right-to-left it spells out the 
calculation we want. Applying it to some value means placing it between its two 
arguments

```apl
    3 rot 12345
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
45123
```

[Try it out yourself!](https://tryapl.org/?clear&q=rot%E2%86%90%7B(%C2%AF1%2B10*%E2%89%A2%E2%8D%95%E2%8D%B5)%7C%E2%8D%B5%C3%9710*%E2%8D%BA%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%203%20rot%2012345&run)

Most of the difficulty I faced when building this was dealing with order-of-operations 
which need to be right-to-left. There are ways to 'swap' the order of arguments 
to a function (such as modulo) to make it read more similarly to the hand-written
expression, but I both couldn't get that to produce the right answer and didn't 
feel it was necessary.

In terms of working with vectors, that's where APL shines. There is a rotate 
glyph `⌽` which when given just one argument reverses a vector, but with a second 
argument does exactly what we want; rotates by that many places

```apl
    x←1 2 3 4 5
    3 ⌽ x
4 5 1 2 3
```

If you don't look too closely at the _type_ of the data, we can use this to rotate
a string made of character digits by again using format `⍕` to make a vector of 
characters from the number

```apl
    3 ⌽ ⍕12345
45123
```

(the whitespace here is purely for demonstration; `3⌽⍕12345` works just the same).

# Uiua

Uiua is a much newer language that has a lot of support for operating on data, 
but it behaves differently to all of the above; it's a stack-based language so 
you work with data on a stack, not as variables. I've played around with it and 
really enjoy working with it - there's even an 
[Exercism track](https://exercism.org/tracks/uiua/) now - but in trying 
to write this solution I realised that I'd only ever worked with one 'thing' on 
the stack, even if that was an entire vector of values. This problem invites us 
to work with a value to be rotated _and_ how many places to rotate it; that 
meant I learned a *lot* about figuring out which value from the stack I want.

Entering operators into Uiua is greatly eased by having translation and 
auto-complete; you don't have to figure out how to type `◿` you can start typing 
`"mod"` and as long as it's a unique completion, Uiua will convert it to the 
appropriate glyph. Additionally, there are some formatting tricks such as taking 
a double-underscore suffix to a function to make a combined glyph with a preset 
value; `log__10` translates to `ₙ₁₀`.

The operators I need here are modulo `◿`, multiply `×`, power `ⁿ`, log10 `ₙ₁₀`, 
ceiling `⌈`, and subtract `-`, with the additional dip `⊙` to use the second 
value on the stack, and backward `˜` to swap the arguments of modulo. I couldn't
immediately think of a way to cleanly get the number of digits of a value (I did 
later, which I'll come back to) so I went the `log10` route and my solution is 
(again, right-to-left)

```uiua
3 12345
˜◿⊙(-1˜ⁿ10⌈ₙ₁₀)⊸×˜ⁿ10
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
45123
```

[Try it out yourself!](https://uiua.org/pad?src=0_16_0-dev_2__MyAxMjM0NQrLnOKXv-KKmSgtMcuc4oG_MTDijIjigpnigoHigoAp4oq4w5fLnOKBvzEwCg==)

Working with vectors is much cleaner here, too, and there's a simple rotate `↻` 
that does the same as APL

```uiua
↻ 3 [1 2 3 4 5]
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
[4 5 1 2 3]
```

Reading this, the vector is placed on the stack, then the value 3 is put on the
top of the stack, then rotate takes two values from the stack and performs that
operation, leaving one value (the result) on the stack.

Uiua also has a really cool feature of "undoing" an operation, where the inverse
can be calculated. If I wanted to turn a string into a number I would use parse
`⋕` and I can do the opposite by prefixing it with un `°` to make "unparse"
which converts a number to a string. Since a string is just a vector of
characters (in this case digits) the rotate works naturally, albeit returning a
string

```uiua
↻ 3 °⋕ 12345
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
"45123"
```

Uiua goes one step further with an under `⍜` which takes some value, performs 
some transformation, applies a function, then _undoes_ that transformation. In my 
case, I want to "unparse then re-parse" which seems like a great fit for this

```uiua
⍜°⋕(↻ 3) 12345
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
45123
```

and returns a number again, because under applies the back-transformation of parse.

The unparse `°⋕` is recognised as a compound and is passed as the first argument 
to under, while I need the rotate and 3 to go together with parentheses. If I 
always wanted to shift by 3 places I could use the double underscore to 'attach' 
the `3` to the rotate producing `rotate__3` `↻₃` but what I have above allows for 
changing that number.

Looking into it this way, it's more obvious that I could get the number of digits 
with `lengthunparse` as `⧻°⋕`, but exploring how to go the long way around was 
entirely worthwhile, and not necessarily longer with `ceilinglog__10` as `⌈ₙ₁₀`.

---

I knew I'd find lots of interesting things when I saw this and I was right - just 
spending the time going through the documentation of these 'basic' functions 
reminded me of things I've forgotten and some new things I don't think I knew 
before.

I'd love to hear what people think about these comparisons - are there points I've
overlooked? Better ways to do it? Different functions in some other languages? 
Considerations I've missed? As always, I can be found on
