I just finished ['Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software) by Charles Petzold which was a really well-written (in my opinion) guided journey from flashing a light in morse code through to building a whole computer, and everything needed along the way.

The section on encoding instructions for the processor (built up from logic gates) - assembly instructions as a human readable version of the machine code - was particularly interesting to me, and as I was describing this to a colleague I 
remembered that it's not the first time I've played with assembly...

I just finished ['Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_The_Hidden_Language_of_Computer_Hardware_and_Software) by Charles Petzold which was a really well-written (in my opinion) guided journey from flashing a light in morse code through to building a whole computer, and everything needed along the way.

The section on encoding instructions for the processor (built up from logic gates) - assembly instructions as a human readable version of the machine code - was particularly interesting to me, and as I was describing this to a colleague I 
remembered that it's not the first time I've played with assembly...

Years and years ago (I don't recall how it actually started) I spent some time trying to solve a puzzle. I don't recall whether I saw the puzzle or a solution first, but I do remember wanting to be able to understand it properly, and ideally be able to use some software _I wrote_ to reach the solution.

The puzzle was just a set of characters on a poster for the (then named) Australian Defence Signals Directorate (now the [Australian Signals Directorate](https://www.asd.gov.au/) - one of our Secret Squirrel orgs) at [ruxcon](https://ruxcon.org.au/) in 2011

Yes, that was a long time ago, but I never wrote up what I did, and now seems like a good enough time to get really distracted.

I would be surprised if I understood it well enough at the time, so I suspect I was aware of [this blogpost](http://0xdec0.blogspot.com/2011/12/ruxcon-dsd-challenge.html) which walks through the solution (spoilers). Nonetheless, I wanted to be able to do that myself, not just follow some instructions - I was confident that I could write enough code (of some sort) to go from this sequence of letters and symbols to the final solution.

My attempts at the time were mostly command-line attempts; the blog post linked above uses only web services, so that felt like I could make it 'my own'. I first needed to get the characters into my computer - that's just writing them out to a text file, say, a file called `dsd`
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
# dsd:
6AAAAABbi8uDwx4zwDPSigOK
ETLCiAM8AHQrg8EBg8MB6+wz
/7/z+TEct0SlpGf5dRyl53US
YQEE56Ri7Kdkj8IAABkcOsw=
```
Knowing that this is base-64 encoded, I can decode it with `hexdump`
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cat dsd | base64 -d | hexdump -C

00000000  e8 00 00 00 00 5b 8b cb  83 c3 1e 33 c0 33 d2 8a  |.....[.....3.3..|

00000020  01 eb ec 33 ff bf f3 f9  31 1c b7 44 a5 a4 67 f9  |...3....1..D..g.|
00000030  75 1c a5 e7 75 12 61 01  04 e7 a4 62 ec a7 64 8f  |u...u.a....b..d.|
00000040  c2 00 00 19 1c 3a cc                              |.....:.|
00000047
```
To just get the bytecode, I used some different options and saved the file as `dsd.hex`
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cat dsd | base64 -d | hexdump  -v -e '/1 %02X ' > dsd.hex

# dsd.hex:
E8 00 00 00 00 5B 8B CB 83 C3 1E 33 C0 33 D2 8A 03 8A 11 32 C2 88 03 3C 00 74 2B 83 C1 01 83 C3 01 EB EC 33 FF BF F3 F9 31 1C B7 44 A5 A4 67 F9 75 1C A5 E7 75 12 61 01 04 E7 A4 62 EC A7 64 8F C2 00 00 19 1C 3A CC 
```
I did go a similar route to the linked blogpost and converted these bytes to shellcode, wrapped them in a C program and disassembled it with `gdb`, but much simpler was to use a better tool, in this case [udis](http://udis86.sourceforge.net/) which I needed to install separately. This 
gives the same result as the blogpost, which was nice
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
udcli -x dsd.hex > dsd.hex.asm

# dsd.hex.asm:

0000000000000046 cc               int3                    
```
At this point, I got a bit lost (at the time) because I didn't understand assembly well enough (or at all), so, continuing with the logic presented in the linked blogpost, I considered just working with the bytes directly.

All we really need to do it take the bytes starting at `0x5` and `0x23` and `xor` them. I figured I'll need the decimal value of these addresses; `0x5` is just 5, but `0x23` = 16*2 + 3 = 35. We can of course get this via `printf`
```{bash, eval = TRUE}
printf "%d\n" 0x23 
```
or less simply with the built-in calculator tool `bc`, going from (input) base 16 to (output) base 10
```{bash, eval = TRUE}
echo "obase=10;ibase=16; 23" | bc
```
I placed the bytes in sequence (removing spaces) with
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
str=$(cat dsd.hex | sed 's/ //g')
echo $str
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo E8000000005B8BCB83C31E33C033D28A038A1132C288033C00742B83C10183C301EBEC33FFBFF3F9311CB744A5A467F9751CA5E77512610104E7A462ECA7648FC20000191C3ACC
```
Since I have 2 characters per hex, `0x5` starts at character 10, and `0x23` starts at character 70, so we define our strings as
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
astr=${str:70} # 0x23 to end
echo $astr
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 33FFBFF3F9311CB744A5A467F9751CA5E77512610104E7A462ECA7648FC20000191C3ACC
```
and
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ bstr=${str:10} # 0x5 to end
$ echo $bstr
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 5B8BCB83C31E33C033D28A038A1132C288033C00742B83C10183C301EBEC33FFBFF3F9311CB744A5A467F9751CA5E77512610104E7A462ECA7648FC20000191C3ACC
```
There is overlap here, which we will have to deal with when we get to it. For now, we want to `xor` these. Let's cut these down to 60 characters (where they start to overlap)
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
trimastr=${astr:0:60}
echo $trimastr
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 33FFBFF3F9311CB744A5A467F9751CA5E77512610104E7A462ECA7648FC2
```
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
trimbstr=${bstr:0:60}
echo $trimbstr
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 5B8BCB83C31E33C033D28A038A1132C288033C00742B83C10183C301EBEC
```
The command `xor` (`^`) chokes on this many digits (in fact, any more than about 8) so I've written a script to `xor` the characters one at a time:
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
for i in {0..59} ; do echo $(( 0x${astr:$i:1} ^ 0x${bstr:$i:1} )) | awk '{printf "%X",$0}' ; done > xor.dat

# xor.dat:
687474703A2F2F7777772E6473642E676F762E61752F6465636F6465642E
```
What about that bit that overlapped? we only xored the first 60 characters, but the length of the string is
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
echo ${#astr}
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 72
```
so we need those first 12 (72-12) characters (6 hex) of overlap
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
olap1=${astr:60:12}
echo $olap1
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 0000191C3ACC
```

The assembly code would have overwritten the overlapped part by the time it reached there, so we need to `xor` with the `xor`'d part, i.e. the first 12 characters of `xor.dat`
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
olap2=$(cat xor.dat | cut -c -12)
echo $olap2
```
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 687474703A2F
```
Now, finally, do the last `xor` (`^`)
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
for i in {0..11} ; do echo $(( 0x${olap1:$i:1} ^ 0x${olap2:$i:1} )) | awk '{printf "%X",$0}' ; done > xorolap.dat

# xorolap.dat:
68746D6C00E3
```
so this needs to go at the end of our xor.dat
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cat xor.dat xorolap.dat > xorfinal.dat

# xorfinal.dat:
687474703A2F2F7777772E6473642E676F762E61752F6465636F6465642E68746D6C00E3
```

The final `00` and after is useless, so let's drop it. Finally, we just need to convert this back to text using `xxd -r`
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cat xorfinal.dat | sed 's/[0]\{2\}.*//' | xxd -r -p > dsd.sol
```

Phew. I'm not going to reveal the solution just yet, because this isn't the end of the story (but I did get the right answer).

So, that's a commandline solution to (at least this part) of the puzzle. But now I know R!

Learning more about assembly from the book 'Code', it occurred to me that the 
operations - which could be implemented with something as simple as telegraph relays (or [crabs](https://hackaday.com/2012/09/28/making-logic-gates-out-of-crabs/)) - were just operations on data. Given an input, produce an output (sort of). A `MOV` operation just moved some value stored at some address to another address (or to/from a register). This felt like it could be simple enough to encode in some R functions. Perhaps not some "pure" R functions, because I _want_ the side-effect of altering a global memory bank, but surely I could do simple things like `ADD`.

I looked around to see if someone else had done this before. As is usually the case with odd requests, Mike (a.k.a. [@coolbutuseless](https://github.com/coolbutuseless)) has done something similar in the form of [r64](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/r64) which I didn't appreciate was a sufficiently distinct flavour of assembly (I never had a Commodore64, we had an [Amstrad CPC664](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC664) on which I really only played games). After a quick [PR](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/r64/pull/1) to bring that repo up to date with other changes by the author (a migration of one dependency) I realised this wasn't what I needed, but did learn a lot from how it was structured.

Okay, on to building something myself. I knew I'd need some memory and some registers. The registers seemed easy - they wouldn't hold a lot and I could address them by name, e.g. `eax`. An environment seemed natural, both because of the named list structure, and because I knew it would be mutable. That seemed like a benefit for this use-case - having a global set of registers I could move data in and out of without making copies of the thing or passing it around everywhere.

Next I'd need memory. I figured a vector of hex value made sense, but I wanted to be able to refer to the first one as `0x00`. Now, the names of a vector need to be a character vector - you can't use the actual hex values
```{r, error = TRUE}
memory <- c(0x00 = 0x19, 0x01 = 0x1a, 0x02 = 0x1b)
```
so we need to use character strings
```{r}
memory <- c("0x00" = 0x19, "0x01" = 0x1a, "0x02" = 0x1b)
memory
```
More importantly, we'll need to ensure we _only_ refer to these by the character 
strings because `[` first tries a coercion to integer, which, side-note, is why this works 
```{r}
(1:10)[2.3] # since as.integer(2.3) == 2
(1:10)[4.7] # since as.integer(4.7) == 4
```
The risk is that we use a hex value to extract an element, in which case we might accidentally try to get the first value with
```{r}
memory[0x00]
```
Instead, we want
```{r}
memory["0x00"]
```
In order to make sure we always do this, we need a `sanitize()` function which 
always returns the string.

We can convert a value to hexmode with `as.hexmode`, but that's a lot of typing, so I added an alias as
```{r, eval = FALSE}
hex <- as.hexmode
```

For processing assembly instructions, we might see something like 
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
mov eax, 0x5
```
which should move the value `0x5` into the register `eax`... so we'll need a way 
to distinguish direct addresses from registers. Worse still, we might refer to the address stored in a register, as `[eax]`. A `reg_or_val()` function would identify anything which points to an address (containing a `[`), any of the named registers, or a value, and would return the address (or where that points).

With all of those pieces, the only thing left is to actually be able to run code.

Assembly runs sequentially through the instructions, unless we encounter some flow 
control opcodes (e.g. `JMP` - jump to address - I'll keep calling them opcodes but mnemonics is a more correct term). The basic process would then be to 
read in the instruction, identify the opcode and the arguments, and execute, modifying the memory and registers in-place. Once that's done, we move to the next instruction.

With flow control we might need to identify a _different_ address to go to next, and that might depend on the status of the registers, for example `JNZ 0x00` jumps to address `0x00` if the zero flag is _not_ set. So, we can execute the current instruction but then apply any flag-based logic to see if we need to go to a new address, and go wherever we should go go next. This is implemented as `runasm()`

That takes care of running the code, but what are we running? Oh, operations. Right. Well, we need some of those. Going through the opcodes I need for the puzzle, I'll need the following:
```
call
pop
mov
add
xor
cmp
jz
jmp
halt
```
`CALL` just pushes a value onto the stack (register `esp`), `POP` retrieves it and
stores it at an address, `MOV` as we said moves a value from place to place, `ADD` 
adds two values, `XOR` does what it suggests, and so on. These don't seem tricky to implement, for example
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mov <- function(x, y) {
  # copy y into x
  res <- hex(reg_or_val(y))
  if (x %in% names(registers)) {
    assign(x, res, envir = registers)
  } else {
    mem[sanitize(x)] <<- sanitize(res)
  }
  return(invisible(NULL))
}
```
The wrinkle will be that particular instructions _also_ update registers, for 
example an `ADD` stores whether the result was `0x00` in the zero-flag register
```{r, eval = FALSE}
function(x, y) {
  # add y to x and save in x
  res <- hex(reg_or_val(x)) + hex(reg_or_val(y))
  if (x %in% names(registers)) {
    assign(x, res, envir = registers)
  } else {
    mem[sanitize(x)] <<- sanitize(res)
  }
  assign("zf", hex(as.integer(res == 0x00)), envir = registers)
  return(invisible(x))
}
```
A `JMP` (or other jump) will check this register and jump (or not) accordingly.

With these pieces in place, an R package was a natural home for the code, so I can now present the `{rx86}` package: https://github.com/jonocarroll/rx86

Let's use it to solve the puzzle!!!

Starting with the puzzle string
```{r}
dsd <- "6AAAAABbi8uDwx4zwDPSigOK
ETLCiAM8AHQrg8EBg8MB6+wz
/7/z+TEct0SlpGf5dRyl53US
YQEE56Ri7Kdkj8IAABkcOsw="
```
we decode it (this time in R)

```{r}
(b64 <- base64enc::base64decode(dsd))
```
This will be the only non-R part: we still need to disassemble the bytecode into assembly, but we can do that _from_ R with a `system()` call to `udcli`
```{r}
(disas <- system("udcli -x", input = paste(b64, collapse = " "), intern = TRUE))
```
We then read this back into R as a data.frame
```{r}
asm <- suppressWarnings(
  readr::read_fwf(paste(disas, collapse = "\n"), 
                  col_types = "ccc",
                  col_positions = readr::fwf_widths(c(16, 16, 21)))
)
colnames(asm) <- c("addr", "bytecode", "instr")
# trim the leading 0s from addr since this is all we're using
asm$addr <- substr(asm$addr, nchar(asm$addr)-1, nchar(asm$addr))
asm
```
The last instruction, `int3`, is an interrupt, but let's generalise it to a `halt` because we'll be done
```{r}
asm[33, "instr"] <- "halt"
```
We can run this with `{rx86}`... we need a memory array and some registers
```{r}
mem <- create_mem()
registers <- create_reg()
```
Then we can run the code
```{r}
runasm(asm)
```
As we saw earlier, the 'code' part of the asm is stored in `0x00` to `0x21` with the remaining addresses being used for temporary storage, from `0x23`. The operations encoded 
perform an `XOR` between the values stored at `0x05` through to `0x21` with those starting at `0x23`, storing the results starting at `0x23`.
Extracting the memory from this offset onward (up to where it zeroes) results in
```{r}
(mem_offset <- mem[which(names(mem) == "0x23"):length(mem)])
```
And then lastly, we need to convert this sequence of hex values into characters. I've added a helper which achieves this, dropping everything after the first null-terminating byte (`0x00`) then 
```{r}
hex2string(mem_offset)
```
TADA!

This example is stored along with the package as a vignette, so
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("dsd_ruxcon_challenge", package = "rx86")
```
The link in this solution just redirects to the ASD frontpage since the puzzle is now over 10 years old, but when it was active it led to a page with some binary
```
0100 0011 0100 1111 0100 1110 0100 0111 0101 0010 0100 0001 0101 0100 0101
0101 0100 1100 0100 0001 0101 0100 0100 1001 0100 1111 0100 1110 0101 0011
```
Originally, I solved this part at the command line by storing this code in a file named `decoded` and running a similar `bc` conversion to before, but this time from binary (ibase=2) to hex (obase=16), storing the result in `decoded.hex`
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
for bin in $(cat decoded) ; do echo "obase=16;ibase=2; $bin" | bc >> decoded.hex ; done
```
From there, removing the line breaks and spaces, and passing through `xxd` in reverse (similar to `hexdump` but reverse works on my machine)
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cat decoded.hex | tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/ //g' | xxd -r -p 
```
Again, I'll hold off showing the answer, but it was correct.

It would be satisfying to also do this in R, so I added another helper in `{rx86}` that does this conversion - it's not terribly complex, but involves splitting a string into pairs of strings (split at some point) and a conversion
```{r}
split_pairs <- function(x, split = "") {
  sst <- strsplit(x, split)[[1]]
  out <- paste0(sst[c(TRUE, FALSE)], sst[c(FALSE, TRUE)])
  paste0(out, collapse = ",")
}

bin2ascii <- function(bin) {
  nolb <- gsub("\n", " ", bin)
  split <- strsplit(split_pairs(paste(nolb, collapse = " "), split = " "), ",")[[1]]
  ints <- strtoi(split, base = 2)
  intToUtf8(ints)
}
```
It appears to do the job
```{r}
binary <- "0100 0011 0100 1111 0100 1110 0100 0111 0101 0010 0100 0001 0101 0100 0101
0101 0100 1100 0100 0001 0101 0100 0100 1001 0100 1111 0100 1110 0101 0011"

bin2ascii(binary)
```
There, an (almost) entirely R solution to the puzzle, and all it took was writing my own x86 assembly parser. 

I did want to see if I'd made my parser too specific and it only worked with this one example around which I'd designed it, so I wanted to add another example. This 
journey started with the book 'Code', so it felt fitting to use an example from there. In the book, an example of multiplying two 8-bit numbers is used, which 
involved an `ADC` (add with carry) operation to handle overflow. This seemed like a good candidate, and I started coding it, but soon realised that the exact routine 
relied on an `add al, 0xff` which has the effect of adding -1 in 8-bit, but on my machine
```{r}
as.integer(0xff)
```
and
```{r}
as.hexmode(-1)
```
which isn't compatible. I _could_ instead code a `SUB` opcode and `sub al, 0x01` (which I did) but at this point I decided to abandon the 8-bit idea and simplify down to just doing essential part of the program which multiplies 127 and 28 through repeated additions (via a loop). The asm for this is also stored in the package, and executing it is as simple as
```{r}
mult_asm <- suppressWarnings(
  readr::read_fwf(system.file("asm", "mult.asm", package = "rx86"), 
                  col_types = "ccc",
                  col_positions = readr::fwf_widths(c(3, 6, 20)))
)
colnames(mult_asm) <- c("addr", "bytecode", "instr")
print(mult_asm)
```
Again, we need a new memory array and some registers
```{r}
mem <- create_mem(len = 64)
registers <- create_reg()
```
Then run the code
```{r}
runasm(mult_asm)
```
The final result can be extracted but it is still a hex value
```{r}
mem[sanitize(0x22)]
```
Converting it to an integer gives the expected result
```{r}
as.integer(mem[sanitize(0x22)])

167*28
```
This, too, is stored as a vignette in the package, and can be found with
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("mult_code_petzold", package = "rx86")
```

The package is far from perfect, and only supports what I needed it to, but I've learned a lot about assembly and got to build something I've always wanted to. Plus I've finally written up my process for this puzzle that has been sitting on a disused laptop for a decade.

That's not quite the end, though - I really wanted to test out what I've learned so far, and what good is a new programming ability without a "Hello, world!" example?

Almost all of the examples I found floating around use 'modern' asm (without the bytecode) and allow such luxuries as "storing a string" and "system calls" - none of that here, thank you. Instead, I added a new opcode mnemonic `int 0x80` which sort of does what it should - it writes to screen the value (converted to character) of whatever is in the register `eax`. That's helpful, but I still need 
the assembly that will use that. This is where I feel I've actually hand-programmed something myself. This is a piece of code that could literally have been punched into a [card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card)

![Punch card](images/Used_Punchcard_(5151286161).jpg)

The whole thing works, of course
```{r}
hello_asm <- suppressWarnings(
  readr::read_fwf(system.file("asm", "helloworld.asm", package = "rx86"), 
                  col_types = "ccc",
                  col_positions = readr::fwf_widths(c(3, 3, 20)))
)
colnames(hello_asm) <- c("addr", "bytecode", "instr")
print(hello_asm)

mem <- create_mem()
registers <- create_reg()

runasm(hello_asm)
```
and I find that honestly, ridiculously pleasing.

This, too, is included in the package as
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("helloworld", package = "rx86")
```
I'm satisfied that `{rx86}` works, at least in some sense.

I've learned a lot along the way, and who knows, maybe I'll add some [more opcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings) to the package. If you have some suggestions, please let me know!
