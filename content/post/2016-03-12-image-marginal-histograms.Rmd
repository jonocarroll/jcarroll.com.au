Another day, another interesting challenge. 

I follow [Bob Rudis' (a.k.a. hrbrmstr's) blog](https://rud.is/b/), typically via [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), and [this post](https://rud.is/b/2016/03/10/some-light-image-processing-creation-with-r/) caught my eye. Partly because I thought I knew of an existing way to do this. As usual, actually getting that to work took a little longer than I might have hoped, but I think the end result is pretty neat.

His post describes the process of writing an R function to take an image file, for example this one

and producing a histogram along the sides of the number of pixels on a given row/column. This is what he created (a different image to the example, I believe)

Something funny is going on with the right-hand histogram; it doesn't line up with the image.

Here's my approach.

It leverages the `png` package to extract the channels into a matrix, converts those to `x,y,z data.frame`s, takes the median value, plots that with `ggplot2`, then leverages `ggExtra::ggMarginal` to add the marginal histograms. Note that the `ggExtra` package has some bugs (it hasn't been maintained in a while) in relation to more recent (possibly the dev branch) of `ggplot2`. I got it working on at least one of my machines. This is my result

I've had several uses for these types of marginal plots lately, so hopefully I can sort out the issues I've been getting in combination with `ggplot2`.
