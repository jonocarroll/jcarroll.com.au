I've been following the drama of the RustConf Keynote Fiasco (RKNF, per [\@fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-rustconf-keynote-fiasco-explained)) 
from a great distance - I'm not involved in that community beyond starting to learn 
the language. But the controversial topic itself [Compile-Time Reflection](https://soasis.org/posts/a-mirror-for-rust-a-plan-for-generic-compile-time-introspection-in-rust/) seemed like something interesting I could learn something about.

I've been following the drama of the RustConf Keynote Fiasco (RKNF, per [\@fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-rustconf-keynote-fiasco-explained)) 
from a great distance - I'm not involved in that community beyond starting to learn 
the language. But the controversial topic itself [Compile-Time Reflection](https://soasis.org/posts/a-mirror-for-rust-a-plan-for-generic-compile-time-introspection-in-rust/) seemed like something interesting I could learn something about.

A good start is usually a Wikipedia page, and I found one called ["Reflective programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming) under the "MetaProgramming" 
category, where it defines

> reflection is the ability of a process to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior

That sounds somewhat familiar from what metaprogramming I've read about. One of the 
great features of R is the ability to inspect and rewrite functions, for example, 
the body of the `sd()` function (calculating the standard deviation of the input) looks 
like

```{r}
sd
```

Trying to extract a "component" of that function results in the ever-classic error

```{r, error = TRUE}
sd[1]
```

*However*, using `body()` we _can_ get to the components of the function

```{r}
body(sd)
body(sd)[1]
```

and we can even mess with it (meaninglessly, in this case)

```{r}
vals <- c(1, 3, 5, 7)
sd(vals)
my_sd <- sd
body(my_sd)[1] <- call("log")
my_sd # note that the function now (wrongly) uses log() instead of sqrt()
my_sd(vals)
```

The Wikipedia page lists the following example of reflection in R

```r
# Without reflection, assuming foo() returns an S3-type object that has method "hello"
obj <- foo()
hello(obj)

# With reflection
class_name <- "foo"
generic_having_foo_method <- "hello"
obj <- do.call(class_name, list())
do.call(generic_having_foo_method, alist(obj))
```

Using a more concrete data object and class, e.g. `tibble::tibble` and `summary` might be 
clearer

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(tibble) # do.call doesn't like pkg::fun as a string

# Without reflection
obj <- tibble(a = 1:2, b = 3:4)
summary(obj)

# With reflection
class_name <- "tibble"
generic_having_foo_method <- "summary"
obj <- do.call(class_name, list(a = 1:2, b = 3:4))
obj
do.call(generic_having_foo_method, alist(obj))
```

So, maybe it's more to do with being able to use a string containing the "name" of 
a function and go and find that function, or just the ability to generate functions 
on-demand based on non-function objects (?). Please, let me know if there's a more 
enlightening explanation.

I still don't think I understand that at all (more time required) but I did note in 
some additional research that "reflection" and "macros" are two very similar concepts. Now 
macros _are_ something I've heard of at least, so I was off to do some more research.

Unfortunately, web searches for the terms "reflection" and "macro" turn up a lot of 
macro-lens photography results. 

I've heard of macros in Julia where they're used to "rewrite" an expression. [This](https://jkrumbiegel.com/pages/2021-06-07-macros-for-beginners/) is a nice rundown 
of the process, as are the [official docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#man-macros). These are 
used in many places. One up-and-coming place is the new [Tidier.jl](https://github.com/TidierOrg/Tidier.jl) which implements the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (at least the most common `dplyr` and `purrr` parts) 
using macros (denoted with a `\@` prefix)

```julia
using Tidier
using RDatasets

movies = dataset("ggplot2", "movies");

@chain movies begin
    @mutate(Budget = Budget / 1_000_000)
    @filter(Budget >= mean(skipmissing(Budget)))
    @select(Title, Budget)
    @slice(1:5)
end
```

Rust uses macros for printing (amongst other things); `println!()` is a macro, 
apparently at least in part because it needs to be able to take an arbitrary 
number of args, so one can write

```rust
>> println!("a = {}, b = {}, c = {}", 1, 2, 3)
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
```

In R there isn't a "proper" way to do this but we _do_ have ways to manipulate code 
and we _do_ have ways to retrieve "unparsed" input, e.g. `substitute()`. A quick look 
for "macros in R" turned up a function in a package that is more than 20 years old (I was 
only starting University when this came out and knew approximately 0 programming) and 
comes with a [journal article](https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf); `gtools::defmacro()` by [Thomas Lumley](https://fosstodon.org/@tslumley@wandering.shop) 
has a construction for writing something that behaves like a macro.

The example code made me do a double-take

```{r}
library(gtools)

####
# macro for replacing a specified missing value indicator with NA
# within a dataframe
###
setNA <- defmacro(df, var, values,
  expr = {
    df$var[df$var %in% values] <- NA
  }
)

# create example data using 999 as a missing value indicator
d <- data.frame(
  Grp = c("Trt", "Ctl", "Ctl", "Trt", "Ctl", "Ctl", "Trt", "Ctl", "Trt", "Ctl"),
  V1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 999, 8, 9, 10),
  V2 = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 999, 2, 999, 999),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)
d

# Try it out
setNA(d, V1, 999)
setNA(d, V2, 999)
d
```

Wait - I thought... there's no assignment in those last lines, but the data is 
being modified!?! Sure enough, the internals of `defmacro` make it clear that this 
is the case, but it seemed like magic. Essentially, this identifies what needs to 
happen, what it needs to happen to (via `substitute()`), and makes it happen in the `parent.frame()`. Neat! So, what else can we do with this?

I thought about it for a while and realised what could be a [te|ho]rrific one...

Just a couple of weeks ago, Danielle Navarro [made a wish](https://fosstodon.org/@djnavarro/110455537858873633) 

> not for the first time I find myself wishing that push() and pop() were S3 generics in #rstats

Now, if you're not familiar with those, `pop(x)` removes the first element of a structure `x` (e.g. a vector) and returns that first value, leaving the original object `x` containing only the remaining elements, whereas `push(x, y)` inserts the value `y` as the first element of `x`, moving the remaining elements down the line. These show up more in object-oriented languages, but they 
don't exist in R.

If we define a vector `a` containing some values

```{r}
a <- c(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9)
```

and we wish to extract the first value, we can certainly do so with 

```{r}
a[1]
```

but, due to the nature of R, the vector `a` is unchanged

```{r}
a
```

Instead, we could remove the first value of `a` with

```{r}
a[-1]
```

but again, `a` remains unchanged - in order to modify `a` we must redefine it as e.g.

```{r}
a <- a[-1]
a
```

If we wanted to build a `pop()` function, we _could_ use `substitute()` to figure out 
what the passed input object was, perform the extraction of the first element, and so on... 

But as we've just seen, there's a better way to define that - a macro!

```{r}
r_pop <- gtools::defmacro(x, expr = {
  ret <- x[1]
  x <- x[-1]
  ret
})
```

Now, if we use that on a vector

```{r}
a <- c(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9)
r_pop(a)
a
```

It works!!!

Danielle wanted a Generic, though, so we can easily make `pop()` a Generic and add methods for 
some classes (which can be further extended).

To that end, I present a brand new package; [{weasel}](https://github.com/jonocarroll/weasel)

![`pop()` goes the {weasel}](images/hex-weasel.png){width=300px height=300px}

This defines `pop()` and `push()` as Generics with methods defined for `vector`s, `list`s, and `data.frame`s

```{r}
a <- list(x = c(2, 3), y = c("foo", "bar"), z = c(3.1, 4.2, 6.9))
a
x <- pop(a)
a
x

a <- data.frame(x = c(2, 3, 4), y = c("foo", "bar", "baz"), z = c(3.1, 4.2, 6.9))
a
x <- pop(a)
a
x

a <- c(1, 4, 1, 5, 9)
a
push(a, 3)
a

a <- data.frame(y = c("foo", "bar", "baz"), z = c(3.1, 4.2, 6.9))
a
push(a, data.frame(y = 99, z = 77))
a
```

I wrote this (simple) package as a bit of an exercise - I really don't think you
should actually use it for anything. The _"looks like it modifies in-place but actually 
doesn't"_ is really non-idiomatic for R. Nonetheless, I was really interested to see 
that `defmacro` can be used as a function definition that the dispatch machinery will respect. The only catch I've found so far is that I can't use ellipses (`...`) in the function signature.

I noticed that [Dirk Schumacher](https://github.com/dirkschumacher) built a similar [`defmacro` package](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/defmacro) more recently, but that appears 
to be more aimed at building macros to be expanded on package load (funnily enough, "compile-time macros" - we've come full circle). This seems like a great opportunity for "inlining" 
some functions. I'll definitely be digging deeper into that one.

Let me know if you have a better explanation of any of the concepts I've (badly) described here; 
I'm absolutely just learning and following [Julia Evans' advice about blogging](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/06/05/some-blogging-myths/).
