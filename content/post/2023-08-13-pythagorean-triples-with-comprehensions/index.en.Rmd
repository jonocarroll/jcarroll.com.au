I've been learning at least one new programming language per month through [Exercism](https://exercism.org) and the #12in23 challenge. I've keep saying, 
every time you learn a new language, you learn something about all the others 
you know. Plus, once you know $N$ languages, the $N+1^{\rm th}$ is significantly easier. This 
post covers a calculation I came across in Haskell, and how I can now do the same 
in a lot of other languages - and perhaps can't as easily in others.

I've been learning at least one new programming language per month through [Exercism](https://exercism.org) and the #12in23 challenge. I've keep saying, 
every time you learn a new language, you learn something about all the others 
you know. Plus, once you know $N$ languages, the $N+1^{\rm th}$ is significantly easier. This 
post covers a calculation I came across in Haskell, and how I can now do the same 
in a lot of other languages - and perhaps can't as easily in others.

All of the languages here, I'm learning via Exercism, or at least I'm completing 
a handful or more exercises in each of the languages, which means learning enough 
of the syntax to be able to complete those. The #12in23 challenge is to 
try 12 languages in 2023... I'm doing just fine so far

![#12in23 progress as of July 2023 - I already have my 12, but no reason to stop now](images/12in23_12.png)

### Haskell

I've been reading the (great!) online version of [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) - Haskell is a (properly) "pure" functional 
language, part of which means it has **no** side-effects, which includes, say, 
printing to the console. Haskell, of course, has a way around this (monads!) but 
it means there's a lot to get through before you even get to a printing "Hello, World!" 
example. It's also _lazy_ which means it doesn't evaluate something if it doesn't 
need to, which makes for some good performance, sometimes.

[This video](https://youtu.be/pUN3algpvMs) does a really nice job explaining the 
principles of pure functional programming using JavaScript to introduce Haskell, 
building recursive functions that only take a single argument and return a 
single value.

One example that caught my eye in the [list comprehensions section](http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out#im-a-list-comprehension) was this

```haskell
ghci> let rightTriangles' = [ (a,b,c) | c <- [1..10], b <- [1..c], a <- [1..b], a^2 + b^2 == c^2, a+b+c == 24]  
ghci> rightTriangles'  
[(6,8,10)]  
```

This perhaps isn't too hard to read, even for those unfamiliar with the language. `ghci` is 
the interactive REPL for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, so the prompt starts with that. 
Haskell uses a `let` binding to identify variables, and the apostrophe just indicates that 
this is a slightly different version compared to the one defined slightly earlier in the chapter.

The list comprehension itself is perhaps not so dissimilar to one you'd find in Python; it 
defines some tuple `(a, b, c)` and `|` identifies some constraints, namely that `c` is taken 
from a range of 1 to 10, `b` is taken from a range of 1 to `c`, and `a` is taken from 
a range of 1 to `b`, along with the criteria that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ (the numbers form a Pythagorean 
triple) and their sum is 24. I discussed the [Pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple) in my [last post](https://jcarroll.com.au/2023/08/11/wrapping-c-code-in-an-r-package/) - no 
coincidence (/s). If you evaluate this line, you more-or-less immediately get back the result

```{haskell, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
[(6,8,10)]
```

which is a Pythagorean triple 

$$6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 10^2$$

for which 

$$a + b + c = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24$$
This isn't a groundbreaking calculation, but I've done a _lot_ of R, and my mind 
was a little blown that such a calculation could really be done in a single line just 
by specifying those constraints. Not a solver, not a grid of values with a filter, just 
specifying constraints.

### R

Anyone who knows me knows I write a lot of R. I wrote [a book](https://beyondspreadsheetswithr.com/) on it. I solved all of the 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 puzzles in [_strictly base_ R](https://github.com/jonocarroll/advent-of-code/tree/main/2022/R) (I really need to write that post). 

Now, R (unfortunately) doesn't have any comprehensions, list or otherwise, so I started to 
wonder how I would do this in R. The best I can come up with is

```{r}
expand.grid(a=1:10, b=1:10, c=1:10) |>
  dplyr::filter(a^2 + b^2 == c^2 & 
                  a + b + c == 24 & 
                  a < b & 
                  b < c)
```

but that involves explicitly creating _all_ 1000 combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`. There 
may be a multi-step way to limit the grid to $a < b$ and $b < c$ but that's more code. Maybe the
Haskell solution also has to generate these behind the scenes, but it isn't up to the user to 
do that, so it feels nicer. I like the `filter()` verb here - technically the `&` joining is 
redundant and I could have passed each condition as its own argument. `expand.grid()` is one 
of those underutilised functions that comes in very handy sometimes - or its cousin 
`tidyr::crossing()` which wraps this and additionally performs de-duplication and sorting.

Now that I know more languages, I felt I could explore this a bit further!

### Python

In Python, which I feel is well-known for list comprehensions, this translates more 
or less 1:1 to

```{python, eval = FALSE}
[(a,b,c) for c in range(1,11) for b in range(1,c) for a in range(1,b) if ((a**2 + b**2) == c**2) if a+b+c==24]
```
```{python, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
[(6, 8, 10)]
```

Of course, ranges are specified differently, but otherwise this follows the Haskell 
solution quite nicely, including the dynamic ranges of `b` and `a` which avoids needing 
to search the entire `10*10*10` space. 

I appreciate there's a silly language war between Python and R but 
honestly, a lot of stuff is written in Python and a lot of people write in Python. 
I figure it's better to understand that language for when I need it than to stick my 
head in the sand and claim some sort of superiority. There's bits I don't like, sure, 
but that doesn't mean I shouldn't learn it. I'm even registered and attending [PyConAU](https://2023.pycon.org.au/) next 
weekend.

### Rust

Rust is a fun language with easily the most helpful compiler ever made - you can make a 
lot of mistakes, but the error messages and hints are unparalleled. I'm currently 
taking [Tim McNamara's](https://fosstodon.org/@timClicks@mastodon.nz) ['How To Learn Rust'](https://learning.accelerant.dev/view/courses/how-to-learn-rust/) course which has a 
lot of practical lessons and I've built some [fun things](https://github.com/jonocarroll/rps.rs) already. I completed the first 13 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 [puzzles in Rust](https://github.com/jonocarroll/advent-of-code/tree/main/2022/Rust), after which it all 
got a bit too complicated (and I do _really_ need to write that post).

Rust doesn't have list comprehensions (I believe there are cargo crates which _do_ add 
such functionality) so it's back to nested loops

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
for c in 1..=10 {
  for b in 1..=c {
    for a in 1..=b {
      if a*a + b*b == c*c && a+b+c == 24 {
        println!("{}, {}, {}", a, b, c);
      }
    }
  }
};
```
```{bash, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
6, 8, 10
```

That doesn't allocate a result at all, it just prints the values when it 
encounters them, and since the loop is nested, it can limit the search to $b \leq c$ and
$a \leq b$, but it _does_ explicitly run the loop across all those combinations. It's 
possible there's a much better way to do this, but I couldn't think of it.

### Common Lisp

I like the idea of Common Lisp, and I'm making my way through [Practical Common Lisp](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/) slowly. I suspect I enjoy some of the descendants 
like Clojure a bit more, but it's absolutely worth learning. Miles McBain has [a great post](https://www.milesmcbain.com/posts/the-roots-of-quotation/)
about how learning about lisp quoting helps understand more of the tidyverse. I have used 
lisp in [a code-golf post](https://jcarroll.com.au/2022/04/02/codegolf-lisp-edition/).

Lisp doesn't have comprehensions so it relies on loops, and again, just prints the 
result, returning `NIL`

```{lein, eval = FALSE}
  (loop for c from 1 to 10
        do (loop for b from 1 to c
                 do (loop for a from 1 to b
                      do (when (and (= (+ a b c) 24) (= (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c)))
                        (format t "~d, ~d, ~d~%" a b c)))))

```
```{lein, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
6, 8, 10
NIL
```

The loop is still constrained to $b \leq c$ and $a \leq b$, but definitely runs 
through all those values.

### Julia

I really want to learn more Julia, but I'm not entirely new to the language. I have completed 
the first 25 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in [Julia](https://github.com/jonocarroll/ProjectEuler_Julia) (by 
no means optimised solutions). I think what's holding me back is the fact that almost 
every presentation using it is so very mathsy - and I'm a physicist by training. I love 
that the tidyverse is making its way over in the forms of [Queryverse](https://www.queryverse.org/), 
[DataFramesMeta](https://juliadata.github.io/DataFramesMeta.jl/stable/), and more recently (and 
most likely with more success) the [Tidier](https://github.com/TidierOrg/Tidier.jl) family.

Julia _does_ have list comprehensions, and additionally has an "element" operator with 
the mathematically-familiar symbol `∈`

```{julia, eval = FALSE}
[(a,b,c) for c ∈ 1:10, b ∈ 1:10, a ∈ 1:10 if (a^2 + b^2 == c^2) && (a+b+c == 24) && b <= c && a <= b]
```
```{julia, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
1-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}:
 (6, 8, 10)
```

Unfortunately, the choices for `b` and `a` still need to run through all 10 values because 
Julia doesn't allow these to be co-defined like Haskell and Python do. I came to Julia from 
mainly only knowing R, so dealing with an output of type `Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}` 
initially proved to be a challenge, but I'd say learning more Rust has made me feel a lot more 
comfortable around working with types.

### Clojure

Clojure feels to me like "lisp, but with good libraries". There's definitely syntax 
differences, but most of them feel like improvements.

```{lein, eval = FALSE}
(for [c (range 11)
      b (range c)
      a (range b)
     :when (and (== (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c)) (== (+ a b c) 24))]
[a b c])
```
```{lein, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
([6 8 10])
```

This still feels like a comprehension, but the syntax is certainly a bit more 
convoluted. Bonus points for the dynamic ranges of `b` and `a`. Still, a long way 
off of completely unreadable, I'd say.

### Scala

I'm learning a lot of functional programming, and I think I'm happy that some of the 
[textbooks](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala-second-edition) use Scala rather than some alternatives. I'm still very new to this language, 
but so far I think I like it.

Again, we're back to a loop, but most of it is straightforward assignments and we 
get the dynamic ranges of `b` and `a`

```{scala, eval = FALSE}
for {
     c <- 1 until 11
     b <- 1 until c
     a <- 1 until b
     if a * a + b * b == c * c & a + b + c == 24
     } {
        println(s"Side lengths: $a, $b, $c")
}
```

```{scala, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
Side lengths: 6, 8, 10
```

### C

I mentioned that I performed this calculation in C in [my last post](https://jcarroll.com.au/2023/08/11/wrapping-c-code-in-an-r-package/) - that 
ends up being just a loop

```{c, eval = FALSE}
int a, b, c

printf("%4s\t%4s\t%4s\t%4s\n", "a", "b", "c");
printf("   -------------------------\n");
for (c = 1; c <= 24; c++) 
  for (b = 1; b <= c; b++)
    for (a = 1; a <= b; a++)
      if ( ( pow ( a, 2 ) + pow ( b, 2 ) ) == pow ( c, 2 ) ) {
        printf("%4i\t%4i\t%4i\t%4i\n", a, b, c);
      }
```

I haven't run the output directly, since it needs an entire program supporting it, but 
it's the right answer.

So, what does it look like if you run all of these together? I've been getting back 
into using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and it's very powerful. One of the 
features is splitting a window into panes, so I did that - one for each of these 
languages!

![Calculating the Pythagorean Triple with perimeter 24 in several languages at once - [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonocarroll/jcarroll.com.au/master/content/post/2023-08-13-pythagorean-triples-with-comprehensions/images/polyglot_triangles.png)](images/polyglot_triangles.png)

I still think the Haskell solution shines above all the rest. It has all of the 
simplicity and language richness with none of the boilerplate. I like that it's 
[declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) ("get an answer to this") 
rather than [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) ("do this, then that, then loop here..."). Comparing all of these, it's clear there's no guarantees about 
being able to define the dynamic iteration ranges so another win for Haskell, there.

Following my last post, [\@Kazinator](https://fosstodon.org/@Kazinator@mstdn.ca) mentioned to me 
that the "TXR Lisp code, calling calcsum directly via FFI using Lisp nested arrays" could 
be written as

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
$ cat calcsum.tl
(typedef arr3d (ptr (array (ptr (array (ptr (array int)))))))

(with-dyn-lib "./calcsum.so"
  (deffi calcsum "calcsum" void (int (ptr arr3d))))

(let* ((dim 16)
       (arr (vector dim)))
  (each ((a 0..dim))
    (set [arr a] (vector dim))
    (each ((b 0..dim))
      (set [[arr a] b] (vector dim 0))))
  (calcsum (pred dim) arr)
  (each-prod ((a 1..dim)
              (b 1..dim)
              (c 1..dim))
    (let ((sum [[[arr a] b] c]))
      (if (plusp sum)
        (put-line (pic "### + ### + ### = ####" a b c sum))))))

$ txr  calcsum.tl
```
```{lein, eval = FALSE, class.output = "bg-success"}
  3 +   4 +   5 =   12
  5 +  12 +  13 =   30
  6 +   8 +  10 =   24
  9 +  12 +  15 =   36
```

This calculates _all_ the combinations up to some value (as my post did) but it's 
already clear there's some cool features there.

How does your favourite language calculate the Pythagorean triple with a sum of 24? What can 
I do better in the solution I have above for a language you know? I can be found on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jonocarroll) or use the comments below.
