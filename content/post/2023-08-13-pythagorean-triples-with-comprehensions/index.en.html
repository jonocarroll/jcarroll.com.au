<p>I’ve been learning at least one new programming language per month through <a href="https://exercism.org">Exercism</a> and the #12in23 challenge. I’ve keep saying,
every time you learn a new language, you learn something about all the others
you know. Plus, once you know <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> languages, the <span class="math inline">\(N+1^{\rm th}\)</span> is significantly easier. This
post covers a calculation I came across in Haskell, and how I can now do the same
in a lot of other languages - and perhaps can’t as easily in others.</p>

<p>I’ve been learning at least one new programming language per month through <a href="https://exercism.org">Exercism</a> and the #12in23 challenge. I’ve keep saying,
every time you learn a new language, you learn something about all the others
you know. Plus, once you know <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> languages, the <span class="math inline">\(N+1^{\rm th}\)</span> is significantly easier. This
post covers a calculation I came across in Haskell, and how I can now do the same
in a lot of other languages - and perhaps can’t as easily in others.</p>
<p>All of the languages here, I’m learning via Exercism, or at least I’m completing
a handful or more exercises in each of the languages, which means learning enough
of the syntax to be able to complete those. The #12in23 challenge is to
try 12 languages in 2023… I’m doing just fine so far</p>

<div id="haskell" class="section level3">
<h3>Haskell</h3>
<p>I’ve been reading the (great!) online version of <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a> - Haskell is a (properly) “pure” functional
language, part of which means it has <strong>no</strong> side-effects, which includes, say,
printing to the console. Haskell, of course, has a way around this (monads!) but
it means there’s a lot to get through before you even get to a “Hello, World!”
example. It’s also <em>lazy</em> which means it doesn’t evaluate something if it doesn’t
need to, which makes for some good performance, sometimes.</p>
<p>One example that caught my eye in the <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out#im-a-list-comprehension">list comprehensions section</a> was this</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>ghci&gt; let rightTriangles&#39; = [ (a,b,c) | c &lt;- [1..10], b &lt;- [1..c], a &lt;- [1..b], a^2 + b^2 == c^2, a+b+c == 24]  
ghci&gt; rightTriangles&#39;  
[(6,8,10)]  </code></pre>
<p>This perhaps isn’t too hard to read, even for those unfamiliar with the language. <code>ghci</code> is
the interactive REPL for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, so the prompt starts with that.
Haskell uses a <code>let</code> binding to identify variables, and the apostrophe just indicates that
this is a slightly different version compared to the one defined slightly earlier in the chapter.</p>
<p>The list comprehension itself is perhaps not so dissimilar to one you’d find in Python; it
defines some tuple <code>(a, b, c)</code> and <code>|</code> identifies some constraints, namely that <code>c</code> is taken
from a range of 1 to 10, <code>b</code> is taken from a range of 1 to <code>c</code>, and <code>a</code> is taken from
a range of 1 to <code>b</code>, along with the criteria that <span class="math inline">\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)</span> (the numbers form a Pythagorean
triple) and their sum is 24. I discussed the Pythagorean triples in my <a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2023/08/11/wrapping-c-code-in-an-r-package/">last post</a> - no
coincidence (/s). If you evaluate this line, you more-or-less immediately get back the result</p>
<pre class="haskell bg-success"><code>[(6,8,10)]</code></pre>
<p>which is a Pythagorean triple</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 10^2\]</span></p>
<p>for which</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[a + b + c = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24\]</span>
This isn’t a groundbreaking calculation, but I’ve done a <em>lot</em> of R, and my mind
was a little blown that such a calculation could really be done in a single line just
by specifying those constraints. Not a solver, not a grid of values with a filter, just
specifying constraints.</p>
</div>
<div id="r" class="section level3">
<h3>R</h3>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows I write a lot of R. I wrote <a href="https://beyondspreadsheetswithr.com/">a book</a> on it. I solved all of the
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> 2022 puzzles in <a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/advent-of-code/tree/main/2022/R"><em>strictly base</em> R</a> (I really need to write that post).</p>
<p>Now, R (unfortunately) doesn’t have any comprehensions, list or otherwise, so I started to
wonder how I would do this in R. The best I can come up with is</p>
<pre class="r"><code>expand.grid(a=1:10, b=1:10, c=1:10) |&gt;
  dplyr::filter(a^2 + b^2 == c^2 &amp; 
                  a + b + c == 24 &amp; 
                  a &lt; b &amp; 
                  b &lt; c)</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>##   a b  c
## 1 6 8 10</code></pre>
<p>but that involves explicitly creating <em>all</em> 1000 combinations of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. There
may be a multi-step way to limit the grid to <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b &lt; c\)</span> but that’s more code. Maybe the
Haskell solution also has to generate these behind the scenes, but it isn’t up to the user to
do that, so it feels nicer. I like the <code>filter()</code> verb here - technically the <code>&amp;</code> joining is
redundant and I could have passed each condition as its own argument. <code>expand.grid()</code> is one
of those underutilised functions that comes in very handy sometimes - or its cousin
<code>tidyr::crossing()</code> which wraps this and additionally performs de-duplication and sorting.</p>
<p>Now that I know more languages, I felt I could explore this a bit further!</p>
</div>
<div id="python" class="section level3">
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>In Python, which I feel is well-known for list comprehensions, this translates more
or less 1:1 to</p>
<pre class="python"><code>[(a,b,c) for c in range(1,11) for b in range(1,c) for a in range(1,b) if ((a**2 + b**2) == c**2) if a+b+c==24]</code></pre>
<pre class="python bg-success"><code>[(6, 8, 10)]</code></pre>
<p>Of course, ranges are specified differently, but otherwise this follows the Haskell
solution quite nicely, including the dynamic ranges of <code>b</code> and <code>a</code> which avoids needing
to search the entire <code>10*10*10</code> space.</p>
<p>I appreciate there’s a silly language war between Python and R but
honestly, a lot of stuff is written in Python and a lot of people write in Python.
I figure it’s better to understand that language for when I need it than to stick my
head in the sand and claim some sort of superiority. There’s bits I don’t like, sure,
but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t learn it. I’m even registered and attending <a href="https://2023.pycon.org.au/">PyConAU</a> next
weekend.</p>
</div>
<div id="rust" class="section level3">
<h3>Rust</h3>
<p>Rust is a fun language with easily the most helpful compiler ever made - you can make a
lot of mistakes, but the error messages and hints are unparalleled. I’m currently
taking <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@timClicks@mastodon.nz">Tim McNamara’s</a> <a href="https://learning.accelerant.dev/view/courses/how-to-learn-rust/">‘How To Learn Rust’</a> course which has a
lot of practical lessons and I’ve built some <a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/rps.rs">fun things</a> already. I completed the first 13 <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> 2022 <a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/advent-of-code/tree/main/2022/Rust">puzzles in Rust</a>, after which it all
got a bit too complicated (and I do <em>really</em> need to write that post).</p>
<p>Rust doesn’t have list comprehensions (I believe there are cargo crates which <em>do</em> add
such functionality) so it’s back to nested loops</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>for c in 1..=10 {
  for b in 1..=c {
    for a in 1..=b {
      if a*a + b*b == c*c &amp;&amp; a+b+c == 24 {
        println!(&quot;{}, {}, {}&quot;, a, b, c);
      }
    }
  }
};</code></pre>
<pre class="bash bg-success"><code>6, 8, 10</code></pre>
<p>That doesn’t allocate a result at all, it just prints the values when it
encounters them, and since the loop is nested, it can limit the search to <span class="math inline">\(b \leq c\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(a \leq b\)</span>, but it <em>does</em> explicitly run the loop across all those combinations. It’s
possible there’s a much better way to do this, but I couldn’t think of it.</p>
</div>
<div id="common-lisp" class="section level3">
<h3>Common Lisp</h3>
<p>I like the idea of Common Lisp, and I’m making my way through <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> slowly. I suspect I enjoy some of the descendants
like Clojure a bit more, but it’s absolutely worth learning. Miles McBain has <a href="https://www.milesmcbain.com/posts/the-roots-of-quotation/">a great post</a>
about how learning about lisp quoting helps understand more of the tidyverse. This
also doesn’t have comprehensions so it relies on loops, and again, just prints the
result, returning <code>NIL</code></p>
<pre class="lein"><code>  (loop for c from 1 to 10
        do (loop for b from 1 to c
                 do (loop for a from 1 to b
                      do (when (and (= (+ a b c) 24) (= (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c)))
                        (format t &quot;~d, ~d, ~d~%&quot; a b c)))))
</code></pre>
<pre class="lein bg-success"><code>6, 8, 10
NIL</code></pre>
<p>The loop is still constrained to <span class="math inline">\(b \leq c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a \leq b\)</span>, but definitely runs
through all those values.</p>
</div>
<div id="julia" class="section level3">
<h3>Julia</h3>
<p>I really want to learn more Julia, but I’m not entirely new to the language. I have completed
the first 25 <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems in <a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/ProjectEuler_Julia">Julia</a> (by
no means optimised solutions). I think what’s holding me back is the fact that almost
every presentation using it is so very mathsy - and I’m a physicist by training. I love
that the tidyverse is making its way over in the forms of <a href="https://www.queryverse.org/">Queryverse</a>,
<a href="https://juliadata.github.io/DataFramesMeta.jl/stable/">DataFramesMeta</a>, and more recently (and
most likely with more success) the <a href="https://github.com/TidierOrg/Tidier.jl">Tidier</a> family.</p>
<p>Julia <em>does</em> have list comprehensions, and additionally has an “element” operator with
the mathematically-familiar symbol <code>∈</code></p>
<pre class="julia"><code>[(a,b,c) for c ∈ 1:10, b ∈ 1:10, a ∈ 1:10 if (a^2 + b^2 == c^2) &amp;&amp; (a+b+c == 24) &amp;&amp; b &lt;= c &amp;&amp; a &lt;= b]</code></pre>
<pre class="julia bg-success"><code>1-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}:
 (6, 8, 10)</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, the choices for <code>b</code> and <code>a</code> still need to run through all 10 values because
Julia doesn’t allow these to be co-defined like Haskell and Python do. I came to Julia from
mainly only knowing R, so dealing with an output of type <code>Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}</code>
initially proved to be a challenge, but I’d say learning more Rust has made me feel a lot more
comfortable around working with types.</p>
</div>
<div id="clojure" class="section level3">
<h3>Clojure</h3>
<p>Clojure feels to me like “lisp, but with good libraries”. There’s definitely syntax
differences, but most of them feel like improvements.</p>
<pre class="lein"><code>(for [c (range 11)
      b (range c)
      a (range b)
     :when (and (== (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c)) (== (+ a b c) 24))]
[a b c])</code></pre>
<pre class="lein bg-success"><code>([6 8 10])</code></pre>
<p>This still feels like a comprehension, but the syntax is certainly a bit more
inscrutable. Still, far from unreadable, I’d say.</p>
</div>
<div id="scala" class="section level3">
<h3>Scala</h3>
<p>I’m learning a lot of functional programming, and I think I’m happy that some of the
<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala-second-edition">textbooks</a> use Scala rather than some alternatives. I’m still very new to this language,
but so far I think I like it.</p>
<p>Again, we’re back to a loop, but most if it is straightforward assignments</p>
<pre class="scala"><code>for {
     c &lt;- 1 until 11
     b &lt;- 1 until c
     a &lt;- 1 until b
     if a * a + b * b == c * c &amp; a + b + c == 24
     } {
        println(s&quot;Side lengths: $a, $b, $c&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<pre class="scala bg-success"><code>Side lengths: 6, 8, 10</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="c" class="section level3">
<h3>C</h3>
<p>I mentioned that I performed this calculation in C in <a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2023/08/11/wrapping-c-code-in-an-r-package/">my last post</a> - that
ends up being just a loop</p>
<pre class="c"><code>int a, b, c

printf(&quot;%4s\t%4s\t%4s\t%4s\n&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;);
printf(&quot;   -------------------------\n&quot;);
for (c = 1; c &lt;= 24; c++) 
  for (b = 1; b &lt;= c; b++)
    for (a = 1; a &lt;= b; a++)
      if ( ( pow ( a, 2 ) + pow ( b, 2 ) ) == pow ( c, 2 ) ) {
        printf(&quot;%4i\t%4i\t%4i\t%4i\n&quot;, a, b, c);
      }</code></pre>
<p>I haven’t run the output directly, since it needs an entire program supporting it, but
it’s the right answer.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what does it look like if you run all of these together? I’ve been getting back
into using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux</a> and it’s very powerful. One of the
features is splitting a window into panes, so I did that - one for each of these
languages!</p>

<div class="figcaption">Calculating the Pythagorean Triple with perimeter 24 in several languages at once</div>
</div>
<p>I still think the Haskell solution shines above all the rest. It has all of the
simplicity and language richness with none of the boilerplate.</p>
<p>Following my last post, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@Kazinator@mstdn.ca">Kaz</a> mentioned to me
that the “TXR Lisp code, calling calcsum directly via FFI using Lisp nested arrays” could
be written as</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ cat calcsum.tl
(typedef arr3d (ptr (array (ptr (array (ptr (array int)))))))

(with-dyn-lib &quot;./calcsum.so&quot;
  (deffi calcsum &quot;calcsum&quot; void (int (ptr arr3d))))

(let* ((dim 16)
       (arr (vector dim)))
  (each ((a 0..dim))
    (set [arr a] (vector dim))
    (each ((b 0..dim))
      (set [[arr a] b] (vector dim 0))))
  (calcsum (pred dim) arr)
  (each-prod ((a 1..dim)
              (b 1..dim)
              (c 1..dim))
    (let ((sum [[[arr a] b] c]))
      (if (plusp sum)
        (put-line (pic &quot;### + ### + ### = ####&quot; a b c sum))))))

$ txr  calcsum.tl</code></pre>
<pre class="lein"><code>  3 +   4 +   5 =   12
  5 +  12 +  13 =   30
  6 +   8 +  10 =   24
  9 +  12 +  15 =   36</code></pre>
<p>This calculates <em>all</em> the combinations up to some value (as my post did) but it’s
already clear there’s some cool features there.</p>
<p>How does your favourite language calculate the Pythagorean triple with a sum of 24? What can
I do better in the solution I have above for a language you know? I can be found on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@jonocarroll">Mastodon</a> or use the comments below.</p>
