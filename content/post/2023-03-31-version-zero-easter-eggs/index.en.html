<p>I’ve just finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593190371">‘Version
Zero’</a> by David Yoon. I really enjoyed
it. There’s some (javascript) code on some separator pages between some of the
chapters that is loosely tied into the plot and general theme of the book. I
love solving puzzles, so what was I supposed to do, just leave it at that?</p>

<p>I’ve just finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593190371">‘Version
Zero’</a> by David Yoon. I really enjoyed
it. There’s some (javascript) code on some separator pages between some of the
chapters that is loosely tied into the plot and general theme of the book. I
love solving puzzles, so what was I supposed to do, just leave it at that?</p>
<p>Incidentally, I’ve hooked my <a href="https://jcarroll.xyz/reading/">reading list into my mini
blog</a> so my ‘Currently Reading’ list is (ideally)
up to date.</p>
<p>I can’t help myself when it comes to puzzles or easter eggs like this.
<a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2022/09/01/asd_coin/">Decrypting the new Australian 50c coin puzzle</a> triggered a conversation
with one of our top spy agencies. I learned a whole lot from solving this
<a href="https://jcarroll.com.au/2022/10/29/complex-puzzle/">Gaussian Primes puzzle</a>.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed the book. I won’t give away too much, but it does a great
job of calmly building up a story, the characters, the plot and then ramping up
the excitement. In the acknowledgements the author thanks his genius nephew Eric Yoon (<a href="yoonicode.com">yoonicode.com</a> - what a great URL!) for the easter egg code.</p>
<p>I figured I’d try to to run the code and see what it does. I wanted to carefully
read this - especially given the theme of the book - to make sure it wasn’t going to
delete my networking setup or something. The first step was to get the code from the
(paper) pages into a computer. I looked around - web search, GitHub, Eric’s site - and
couldn’t find an online copy anywhere. I tried searching for a few other unique-looking
terms in the code but nothing. <em>Has no one written up a discussion about this easter egg?</em> The
book is from 2021, so it’s not <em>that</em> new. I came across it randomly walking the shelves
at my local library (credit to librarians for prominently featuring great suggestions!). Maybe
I’ve just overlooked a write up somewhere, but maybe I’m the first?</p>
<p>I had a go at OCR via <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a>
but since it’s javascript and not a text language, it didn’t have much luck.
There are supposedly some language packs for tesseract but none of them helped
with the images I have.</p>
<p>So, with no digital copy of the code to pull in, I guess the only thing to do is
to <del>forget about it and move on</del>MANUALLY TYPE ALL 80-SOMETHING LINES IN. This
was … interesting, but not too bad, really. The choice of font in the book and
somewhat
low dpi meant that the difference between <code>(</code> and <code>{</code> was <em>very</em> subtle. Having a
little bit of domain knowledge helps in this case. Entering the code was otherwise just a matter
of typing until I got to this (or what looks something like this) line</p>
<pre><code>subunit.push(btoa(&quot;ß]xëÏz×|ç¼Û¾v&quot;));</code></pre>
<p>Oh… No.</p>
<p>My best guess was to use Google Docs’ ‘insert character’ which lets you draw the symbol
you’re looking for and gives some options.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/insertchar.png" width="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Google Docs’ insert character dialog</p>
</div>
<p>The next step was to actually confirm that I hadn’t
made any transcription errors, which should show up if I try to run the code. I checked
that I could run a file of javascript code with <code>node</code> and it worked, sort of. It failed about
halfway through because a function wasn’t defined - <code>btoa</code> and <code>atob</code> are <a href="https://dev.to/2ezpz2plzme/btoa-replacement-in-nodejs-3k6g">deprecated in Node</a>. I added some definitions
for <code>atob</code> and <code>btoa</code> and that was resolved</p>
<pre><code>atob = a =&gt; Buffer.from(a, &#39;base64&#39;).toString(&#39;binary&#39;)
btoa = b =&gt; Buffer.from(b, &#39;binary&#39;).toString(&#39;base64&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The code didn’t run, though, because some values didn’t convert to <code>BigInt</code>,
probably because I’d entered them wrong.</p>
<p>I carefully went through what I’d entered and did realise that there was only a subtle
difference between <code>1</code> (one) and <code>l</code> (lowercase <code>L</code>) and made some fixes.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the code ran until it hit the <code>BigInt</code> conversion of a
particular value and failed. I forced the code to skip over that value and got to
an answer. The result of running the code is similar to the <a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/R/R/day10.R%20-%20which%20I&#39;m%20still%20yet%20to%20write%20up">Advent of Code 2022
Day 10 Part Two
puzzle</a> which writes out <code>#</code> and spaces in lines to
spell out ASCII-art words. Clearly my code was broken, because I could see what it
was <em>supposed</em> to spell out, and there were errors.</p>
<p>I figured I had to trace back through the result being built up and figure out
which values end up on which lines. Extra fun, because there’s a <code>filter</code> in the
middle that removes some of the input. Sure enough, one of the offending lines was
the unicode-salad line above - great. The other seemed to be</p>
<pre><code>const datetime = new Date(1997, 7, 24);</code></pre>
<p>Super great - this is going to involve a timezone issue, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Back to the unicode, I searched again for this specific line (minus the unicode) and
actually did get a hit - Google Books has a copy of the (Czech?) translation of the
book and returns this line. Not precisely (something hasn’t encoded correctly) and
not selectable in the book, but selectable in the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22subunit.push%22+btoa">Google result for it</a>. That wasn’t much
help after all.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the code and see how it works before we resolve it. A full
copy (with my own annotations and fixes) is
<a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/versionzero">here</a>, if anyone else wants to not
have to type all of it in.</p>
<pre><code>const VERSION_NUMBER = 0;
const AGENT = &quot;BLACK HALO&quot;;
const year = 0x2018;
const enc = [
    021, 024, 015, 015,
    026, -031, 030, 016,
    034, 027, 021, 034,
    021, 014, 025, -022,
    017, 016, 032, 027
];
let res = [&quot;You are infinite&quot;];
RANDOM_SEED = 20879976793454946324n;</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 0
## BLACK HALO
## 8216
## 17,20,13,13,22,-25,24,14,28,23,17,28,17,12,21,-18,15,14,26,23
## You are infinite
## 20879976793454946324</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. Some constants and the start of a result <code>res</code> - an array
containing some text.</p>
<pre><code>if (VERSION_NUMBER % 2 &lt; 1) res.shift();</code></pre>
<p>With <code>VERSION_NUMBER == 0</code> this just drops the first (and only) value of <code>res</code>, so
we’re back to an empty result.</p>
<pre><code>res.push(enc.map((i, idx) =&gt; {
    return String.fromCharCode(
        AGENT.charCodeAt(
            idx % AGENT.length
        ) - i
    );
}).reduce((i, j) =&gt; {
    return i.toString() + j.toString();
}));
res[0]</code></pre>
<pre class="javascript bg-success"><code>## 18465903081007629328</code></pre>
<p>This does some math on the characters of <code>AGENT</code> and produces what will eventually
be the <em>second</em> line of actual output (currently the first).</p>
<pre><code>res.unshift(atob(&quot;MzU3NzU1MDM2NTgxMDMzNTg0OTU=&quot;));
res[0]</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 35775503658103358495</code></pre>
<p>This becomes the <em>first</em> line of output due to the <code>unshift</code>.</p>
<pre><code>res.push(
    (8939935261623587079n &lt;&lt; 2n).toString() 
);
res.push((RANDOM_SEED &amp; 0x18C445CAC40447832n | 0n).toString());
res.push(&quot;&quot; + (151845383424178857009896n / BigInt(year)));</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 35759741046494348316
## 18465906380616247312
## 18481667894861107231</code></pre>
<p>become the third, fourth, and fifth line of the output.</p>
<p>The next lines set up something to be used later,</p>
<pre><code>let as_json = {
    coordinates: &#39;{&quot;x&quot;: 2, &quot;y&quot;: 5}&#39;,
    tolerance: 0.1,
    subunit: [2 ** 8]
};
const c = JSON.parse(as_json.coordinates);</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## { coordinates: &#39;{&quot;x&quot;: 2, &quot;y&quot;: 5}&#39;, tolerance: 0.1, subunit: [ 256 ] }
## { x: 2, y: 5 }</code></pre>
<p>Then adds a separator of <code>0</code> to the result</p>
<pre><code>res.push((z =&gt; `value: ${z}`.slice(7))((x =&gt; x &gt;&gt;&gt; 42)(3 ** 5)));</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 0</code></pre>
<p>The next part is a bit of a red herring since it sets up a <code>subunit</code> object</p>
<pre><code>let subunit = as_json[&quot;subunit&quot;];
eval(&quot;subunit&quot; + `${String.fromCharCode(46)}pop()`);</code></pre>
<p>but the <code>eval</code> results in</p>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## subunit.pop()</code></pre>
<p>so that is back to empty.</p>
<p>This adds some data to <code>subunit</code></p>
<pre><code>subunit.push(69 + 114 + 105 + 99 + 32 + 89 + 111 + 111 + 110);</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 840</code></pre>
<p>but again it’s overwritten with</p>
<pre><code>subunit[0] = Math.round(euclidianDistance(c.x, c.y, 48, 1967.46095)) + &quot;4568824394612736&quot;; 
[...]
/**
    * @returns the distance between 2d point (x, y) and (x1, y1)
    */
function euclidianDistance(x, y, x1, y1) {
    return Math.sqrt(((x - x1) ** 2) + ((y - y1) ** 2));
}</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 19634568824394612736</code></pre>
<p>This is the first line of the second block of output.</p>
<p>The next line of output <em>should</em> come from the code that I have as</p>
<pre><code>subunit.push(btoa(&quot;ß]xëÏz×|ç¼Û¾v&quot;));
res = res.concat(subunit);</code></pre>
<p>but that produces</p>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 3114689613znvNu+dg==</code></pre>
<p>which doesn’t convert to <code>BigInt</code> at all. We’ll come back to that.</p>
<pre><code>const str = &quot;MjQyNDI4NzczNDQ0MjgwNjQ3Njg=bMTk2MTc2ODAxMTY0MTIzMTc2OTY=bMTk2MzQ1Njg0OTI2MDgzODkxMjA=bMA==&quot;; 
res = res.concat(str.split(&quot;b&quot;).map(b =&gt; atob(b)));</code></pre>
<p>splits up the <code>str</code> at the letter <code>b</code> and runs <code>atob</code> over the pieces</p>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## [
##   &#39;24242877344428064768&#39;,
##   &#39;19617680116412317696&#39;,
##   &#39;19634568492608389120&#39;,
##   &#39;0&#39;
## ]</code></pre>
<p>providing the rest of the second block of output and the next separator.</p>
<p>The next lines set up a <code>Date</code> object and extracts part of the string representation
(local timezone, but it’s just taking the <code>"19"</code> from <code>"1997"</code>)</p>
<pre><code>const datetime = new Date(1997, 7, 24);
res.push(
    datetime.toString().slice(11, 13) +
        (
            634601705079659136n +
            BigInt(datetime.getTime())
        )
);</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 19634602577426259136</code></pre>
<p>which <em>looks</em> okay, but gives the wrong value on the first line of the last
block - another one to come back to.</p>
<p>The next lines were fun to enter and validate (not)</p>
<pre><code>res = res.concat(
    [
        &quot;Mjg4NDIxOTU1MjI5NzAyMDYyMDg=&quot;, /** block 3, line 2 */
        &quot;MTVkIGhlcnJpbmcgZ2V0IHJla3Q=&quot;, 
        &quot;MTEwNTI5MDA1Mjk2MDU5NzY2MTM0&quot;,
        &quot;MjQyMzA1MjI2OTg2ODIzNjM5MDQ=&quot;, /** block 3, line 3 */
        &quot;SG9wZSB5b3UgbGlrZSBSZWdleCE=&quot;, 
        &quot;MTk1MjA0NjkyMDUyODYzMDQ0MDM=&quot;,
        &quot;MjE5MjQ2NjY0OTUzMjkxMjQzNTI=&quot;, /** block 3, line 4 */
        &quot;MjYwMjg2MDQ4NjAyODMwNTUxMDI=&quot;,
        &quot;MTk2MzQ2MDI1OTM2MDc1MTUxMzY=&quot;, /** block 3, line 5 */
        &quot;TG92ZSwgUGlsb3QuIDwzICA8MyA=&quot;, 
        &quot;MzA0NTgyNTg0Mzk1NzM4OTU3OTM5&quot;
    ].filter( 
       i =&gt; i.match(/M[j|T].+[QUINOA][x12][DjTLMNOP]{2}[^aeiou]\*?.{1,5}[a-zA-Z5]+=/g) 
    ).map(atob)
).map((i, j) =&gt; {
    if(j &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 12 &amp;&amp; j != 7) {
        return BigInt(i) &amp; BigInt(31775n &lt;&lt; 50n);
    }
    return i;
});</code></pre>
<p>This involves filtering some entries from the big block of encoded text,
running the remaining ones through <code>atob</code>, then doing some math on these combined
with all the other values from <code>res</code> (effectively only updating the second block of values).</p>
<p>While debugging this, I found another easter egg hidden within - one that wouldn’t
be found just by running the code itself. Some of the lines filtered out by the regex
convert to plaintext!</p>
<pre><code>atob(&quot;MTVkIGhlcnJpbmcgZ2V0IHJla3Q=&quot;)
atob(&quot;SG9wZSB5b3UgbGlrZSBSZWdleCE=&quot;)
atob(&quot;TG92ZSwgUGlsb3QuIDwzICA8MyA=&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 15d herring get rekt
## Hope you like Regex!
## Love, Pilot. &lt;3  &lt;3</code></pre>
<p>Niiiiice!</p>
<p>The final lines of code take these values, convert to binary, and print a <code>#</code> for
each <code>1</code> (and a space otherwise)</p>
<pre><code>for (const i of res) {
    const bin = BigInt(i).toString(2);
    let ln = &quot;&quot;;
    for (const j of bin) ln += j == &quot;0&quot; ? &quot; &quot; : &quot;#&quot;;
    console.log(ln);
}</code></pre>
<p>If you do that, a message (slightly corrupted) appears.</p>
<p>I decided to work backwards, since I was fairly sure what the ‘right’ solution
should be. Taking those lines (manually corrected), converting them all the way
back through the processing in reverse, I could see what the ‘right’ code should
be.</p>
<p>The unicode line that produces what I think is the “right” solution is</p>
<pre><code>subunit.push(btoa(&quot;ß]xëÏyÓm¼÷\x8DùÓ}ú&quot;));</code></pre>
<p>The characters are mainly close but not perfect, so maybe a <code>LOCALE</code> issue? Something
to do with Linux (which I’m on) vs Windows?</p>
<p>The date line seems to be off by exactly 16 hours and 30 minutes which is
disturbingly likely to be a timezone issue. I’m at GMT+10:30 (Adelaide, South
Australia) at the moment. StackOverflow seems to have a lot of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9756120/how-do-i-get-a-utc-timestamp-in-javascript">angry
comments</a>
regarding whether or not this is an issue for <code>Date()</code>. I seem to be able to get
the “right” solution with</p>
<pre><code>const datetime = new Date(1997, 7, 24, 16, 30);</code></pre>
<p>With all that in place, it’s time to run all of the code! If I do that, I get…</p>

<p>which is fitting, and thoroughly satisfying to finally produce.</p>
<p>I also ran this code (with my corrections, minus the <code>atob</code> and <code>btoa</code>
definitions) over on <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle.net/</a> and it seems to give
the right solution, which makes me think perhaps it really is an error in the
code or how it was printed.</p>
<p>What an adventure! I learned a lot of javascript (how to run it with <code>node</code> and
in a browser for debugging), played with
<a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">tesseract</a>, and learned about
entering unicode. I’m sending this to Eric Yoon for comment and will update if I
hear anything.</p>
<p>As a side note for this post, you’ll notice that the code blocks are all nicely
rendered as usual - in this case they’re the actual javascript from the easter
egg code. <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/">{knitr}</a> <em>does</em> have a way to evaluate
javascript in code chunks with the <code>node</code> engine, but that essentially runs
<code>node -e 'CODE'</code> on each chunk independently, so you can’t define a variable in
one chunk then reference it in another. That wasn’t sufficient for this
exploration. I did find an (old)
<a href="https://github.com/yihui/runr/pull/18">implementation</a> that uses
<a href="https://github.com/jeroen/V8">{V8}</a> in Yihui’s (already experimental)
<a href="https://github.com/yihui/runr">{runr}</a>, but it was written for a much older
version of <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/">{knitr}</a> and was out of date.</p>
<p>So, of course the thing to do was <del>just hardcode the output</del>SHAVE A YAK AND UPDATE
THE IMPLEMENTATION. If you’d like to have javascript code chunks in your Rmd, I’ve made
<a href="https://github.com/stla/runr/pull/1/files">a pull request</a> to that original implementation
and have <a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/runr">my own fork</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to work okay, with the exception that it doesn’t pull in <code>Buffer</code> so my
custom <code>atob</code> function doesn’t work, and it doesn’t have another. It’s also going
wrong in terms of the persistent context in that the <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> directives
are being seen multiple times and it doesn’t like that. Otherwise, variables persist
across chunks just fine - these chunks are fully live:</p>
<p>Define a variable <code>x</code></p>
<pre class="v8"><code>x = 1 + 5;</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 6</code></pre>
<p>Then continue the block</p>
<pre class="v8"><code>x + 12</code></pre>
<pre class="bg-success"><code>## 18</code></pre>
<p>So, that’s working.</p>
<p>As always, leave a comment if you have one, or find me on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@jonocarroll">Mastodon</a> (I’m much
less on Twitter these days). If you have a correction or annotation to add to
the code it’s <a href="https://github.com/jonocarroll/versionzero">here</a>.</p>
