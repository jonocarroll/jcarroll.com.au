I've just finished reading ['Version
Zero'](https://micro.blog/books/9780593190371) by David Yoon. I really enjoyed
it. There's some (javascript) code on some separator pages between some of the
chapters that is loosely tied into the plot and general theme of the book. I
love solving puzzles, so what was I supposed to do, just leave it at that?

I've just finished reading ['Version
Zero'](https://micro.blog/books/9780593190371) by David Yoon. I really enjoyed
it. There's some (javascript) code on some separator pages between some of the
chapters that is loosely tied into the plot and general theme of the book. I
love solving puzzles, so what was I supposed to do, just leave it at that?

Incidentally, I've hooked my [reading list into my mini
blog](https://jcarroll.xyz/reading/) so my 'Currently Reading' list is (ideally)
up to date.

I can't help myself when it comes to puzzles or easter eggs like this.
[Decrypting the new Australian 50c coin puzzle](https://jcarroll.com.au/2022/09/01/asd_coin/) triggered a conversation
with one of our top spy agencies. I learned a whole lot from solving this
[Gaussian Primes puzzle](https://jcarroll.com.au/2022/10/29/complex-puzzle/).

I very much enjoyed the book. I won't give away too much, but it does a great
job of calmly building up a story, the characters, the plot and then ramping up
the excitement. In the acknowledgements the author thanks his genius nephew Eric Yoon ([yoonicode.com](yoonicode.com) - what a great URL!) for the easter egg code.

I figured I'd try to to run the code and see what it does. I wanted to carefully 
read this - especially given the theme of the book - to make sure it wasn't going to 
delete my networking setup or something. The first step was to get the code from the 
(paper) pages into a computer. I looked around - web search, GitHub, Eric's site - and 
couldn't find an online copy anywhere. I tried searching for a few other unique-looking 
terms in the code but nothing. _Has no one written up a discussion about this easter egg?_ The 
book is from 2021, so it's not *that* new. I came across it randomly walking the shelves 
at my local library (credit to librarians for prominently featuring great suggestions!). Maybe 
I've just overlooked a write up somewhere, but maybe I'm the first?

I had a go at OCR via [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
but since it's javascript and not a text language, it didn't have much luck.
There are supposedly some language packs for tesseract but none of them helped
with the images I have.

So, with no digital copy of the code to pull in, I guess the only thing to do is
to ~~forget about it and move on~~MANUALLY TYPE ALL 80-SOMETHING LINES IN. This
was ... interesting, but not too bad, really. The choice of font in the book and
somewhat
low dpi meant that the difference between `(` and `{` was *very* subtle. Having a
little bit of domain knowledge helps in this case. Entering the code was otherwise just a matter
of typing until I got to this (or what looks something like this) line

```
subunit.push(btoa("ß]xëÏz×|ç¼Û¾v"));
```

Oh... No.

My best guess was to use Google Docs' 'insert character' which lets you draw the symbol 
you're looking for and gives some options.

![Google Docs' insert character dialog](images/insertchar.png){width=300px}

The next step was to actually confirm that I hadn't 
made any transcription errors, which should show up if I try to run the code. I checked 
that I could run a file of javascript code with `node` and it worked, sort of. It failed about 
halfway through because a function wasn't defined - `btoa` and `atob` are [deprecated in Node](https://dev.to/2ezpz2plzme/btoa-replacement-in-nodejs-3k6g). I added some definitions 
for `atob` and `btoa` and that was resolved

```
atob = a => Buffer.from(a, 'base64').toString('binary')
btoa = b => Buffer.from(b, 'binary').toString('base64')
```

The code didn't run, though, because some values didn't convert to `BigInt`,
probably because I'd entered them wrong.

I carefully went through what I'd entered and did realise that there was only a subtle 
difference between `1` (one) and `l` (lowercase `L`) and made some fixes.

Apart from that, the code ran until it hit the `BigInt` conversion of a
particular value and failed. I forced the code to skip over that value and got to
an answer. The result of running the code is similar to the [Advent of Code 2022
Day 10 Part Two
puzzle](https://github.com/jonocarroll/advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/R/R/day10.R
- which I'm still yet to write up) which writes out `#` and spaces in lines to 
spell out ASCII-art words. Clearly my code was broken, because I could see what it 
was _supposed_ to spell out, and there were errors. 

I figured I had to trace back through the result being built up and figure out 
which values end up on which lines. Extra fun, because there's a `filter` in the 
middle that removes some of the input. Sure enough, one of the offending lines was 
the unicode-salad line above - great. The other seemed to be

```
const datetime = new Date(1997, 7, 24);
```

Super great - this is going to involve a timezone issue, isn't it?

Back to the unicode, I searched again for this specific line (minus the unicode) and 
actually did get a hit - Google Books has a copy of the (Czech?) translation of the 
book and returns this line. Not precisely (something hasn't encoded correctly) and 
not selectable in the book, but selectable in the [Google result for it](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22subunit.push%22+btoa). That wasn't much 
help after all.

Let's walk through the code and see how it works before we resolve it. A full
copy (with my own annotations and fixes) is
[here](https://github.com/jonocarroll/versionzero), if anyone else wants to not
have to type all of it in.

```
const VERSION_NUMBER = 0;
const AGENT = "BLACK HALO";
const year = 0x2018;
const enc = [
    021, 024, 015, 015,
    026, -031, 030, 016,
    034, 027, 021, 034,
    021, 014, 025, -022,
    017, 016, 032, 027
];
let res = ["You are infinite"];
RANDOM_SEED = 20879976793454946324n;
```
```{V8, echo = FALSE}
VERSION_NUMBER = 0;
AGENT = "BLACK HALO";
year = 0x2018;
enc = [
    021, 024, 015, 015,
    026, -031, 030, 016,
    034, 027, 021, 034,
    021, 014, 025, -022,
    017, 016, 032, 027
];
res = ["You are infinite"];
RANDOM_SEED = 20879976793454946324n;
```

So far so good. Some constants and the start of a result `res` - an array
containing some text.

```
if (VERSION_NUMBER % 2 < 1) res.shift();
```

With `VERSION_NUMBER == 0` this just drops the first (and only) value of `res`, so 
we're back to an empty result.

```
res.push(enc.map((i, idx) => {
    return String.fromCharCode(
        AGENT.charCodeAt(
            idx % AGENT.length
        ) - i
    );
}).reduce((i, j) => {
    return i.toString() + j.toString();
}));
res[0]
```
```{node, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
## 18465903081007629328
```
This does some math on the characters of `AGENT` and produces what will eventually 
be the _second_ line of actual output (currently the first).

```
res.unshift(atob("MzU3NzU1MDM2NTgxMDMzNTg0OTU="));
res[0]
```
```{node, echo = FALSE}
atob = a => Buffer.from(a, 'base64').toString('binary')
console.log(atob("MzU3NzU1MDM2NTgxMDMzNTg0OTU="));
```

This becomes the _first_ line of output due to the `unshift`.

```
res.push(
    (8939935261623587079n << 2n).toString() 
);
res.push((RANDOM_SEED & 0x18C445CAC40447832n | 0n).toString());
res.push("" + (151845383424178857009896n / BigInt(year)));
```
```{node, echo = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
console.log((8939935261623587079n << 2n).toString())
console.log((20879976793454946324n & 0x18C445CAC40447832n | 0n).toString())
console.log("" + (151845383424178857009896n / BigInt(0x2018)))
```

become the third, fourth, and fifth line of the output.

The next lines set up something to be used later, 

```
let as_json = {
    coordinates: '{"x": 2, "y": 5}',
    tolerance: 0.1,
    subunit: [2 ** 8]
};
const c = JSON.parse(as_json.coordinates);
```
```{node, echo = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
as_json = {
    coordinates: '{"x": 2, "y": 5}',
    tolerance: 0.1,
    subunit: [2 ** 8]
};
console.log(as_json);
console.log(JSON.parse(as_json.coordinates));
```

Then adds a separator of `0` to the result

```
res.push((z => `value: ${z}`.slice(7))((x => x >>> 42)(3 ** 5)));
```
```{node, echo = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
console.log((z => `value: ${z}`.slice(7))((x => x >>> 42)(3 ** 5)));
```

The next part is a bit of a red herring since it sets up a `subunit` object 
```
let subunit = as_json["subunit"];
eval("subunit" + `${String.fromCharCode(46)}pop()`);
```
but the `eval` results in 
```{node, echo = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
console.log("subunit" + `${String.fromCharCode(46)}pop()`);
```
so that is back to empty.

This adds some data to `subunit`

```
subunit.push(69 + 114 + 105 + 99 + 32 + 89 + 111 + 111 + 110);
```
```{node, echo = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
console.log(69 + 114 + 105 + 99 + 32 + 89 + 111 + 111 + 110);
```
but again it's overwritten with

```
subunit[0] = Math.round(euclidianDistance(c.x, c.y, 48, 1967.46095)) + "4568824394612736"; 
[...]
/**
    * @returns the distance between 2d point (x, y) and (x1, y1)
    */
function euclidianDistance(x, y, x1, y1) {
    return Math.sqrt(((x - x1) ** 2) + ((y - y1) ** 2));
}
```
```{node, echo = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
let as_json = {
    coordinates: '{"x": 2, "y": 5}',
    tolerance: 0.1,
    subunit: [2 ** 8]
};
const c = JSON.parse(as_json.coordinates);
function euclidianDistance(x, y, x1, y1) {
    return Math.sqrt(((x - x1) ** 2) + ((y - y1) ** 2));
}
console.log(Math.round(euclidianDistance(c.x, c.y, 48, 1967.46095)) + "4568824394612736");
```

This is the first line of the second block of output.

The next line of output _should_ come from the code that I have as

```
subunit.push(btoa("ß]xëÏz×|ç¼Û¾v"));
res = res.concat(subunit);
```
but that produces
```{node, echo = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
btoa = b => Buffer.from(b, 'binary').toString('base64')
console.log(btoa("ß]xëÏz×|ç¼Û¾v"));
```
which doesn't convert to `BigInt` at all. We'll come back to that.

```
const str = "MjQyNDI4NzczNDQ0MjgwNjQ3Njg=bMTk2MTc2ODAxMTY0MTIzMTc2OTY=bMTk2MzQ1Njg0OTI2MDgzODkxMjA=bMA=="; 
res = res.concat(str.split("b").map(b => atob(b)));
```
splits up the `str` at the letter `b` and runs `atob` over the pieces
```{node, echo = FALSE}
atob = a => Buffer.from(a, 'base64').toString('binary')
const str = "MjQyNDI4NzczNDQ0MjgwNjQ3Njg=bMTk2MTc2ODAxMTY0MTIzMTc2OTY=bMTk2MzQ1Njg0OTI2MDgzODkxMjA=bMA=="; 
console.log(str.split("b").map(b => atob(b)));
```
providing the rest of the second block of output and the next separator.

The next lines set up a `Date` object and extracts part of the string representation 
(local timezone, but it's just taking the `"19"` from `"1997"`)
```
const datetime = new Date(1997, 7, 24);
res.push(
    datetime.toString().slice(11, 13) +
        (
            634601705079659136n +
            BigInt(datetime.getTime())
        )
);
```
```{node, echo = FALSE}
const datetime = new Date(1997, 7, 24);
console.log(datetime.toString().slice(11, 13) +
        (
            634601705079659136n +
            BigInt(datetime.getTime())
        ));
```
which *looks* okay, but gives the wrong value on the first line of the last
block - another one to come back to.

The next lines were fun to enter and validate (not) 

```
res = res.concat(
    [
        "Mjg4NDIxOTU1MjI5NzAyMDYyMDg=", /** block 3, line 2 */
        "MTVkIGhlcnJpbmcgZ2V0IHJla3Q=", 
        "MTEwNTI5MDA1Mjk2MDU5NzY2MTM0",
        "MjQyMzA1MjI2OTg2ODIzNjM5MDQ=", /** block 3, line 3 */
        "SG9wZSB5b3UgbGlrZSBSZWdleCE=", 
        "MTk1MjA0NjkyMDUyODYzMDQ0MDM=",
        "MjE5MjQ2NjY0OTUzMjkxMjQzNTI=", /** block 3, line 4 */
        "MjYwMjg2MDQ4NjAyODMwNTUxMDI=",
        "MTk2MzQ2MDI1OTM2MDc1MTUxMzY=", /** block 3, line 5 */
        "TG92ZSwgUGlsb3QuIDwzICA8MyA=", 
        "MzA0NTgyNTg0Mzk1NzM4OTU3OTM5"
    ].filter( 
       i => i.match(/M[j|T].+[QUINOA][x12][DjTLMNOP]{2}[^aeiou]\*?.{1,5}[a-zA-Z5]+=/g) 
    ).map(atob)
).map((i, j) => {
    if(j > 5 && j < 12 && j != 7) {
        return BigInt(i) & BigInt(31775n << 50n);
    }
    return i;
});
```
This involves filtering some entries from the big block of encoded text, 
running the remaining ones through `atob`, then doing some math on these combined
with all the other values from `res` (effectively only updating the second block of values).

While debugging this, I found another easter egg hidden within - one that wouldn't 
be found just by running the code itself. Some of the lines filtered out by the regex 
convert to plaintext!

```
atob("MTVkIGhlcnJpbmcgZ2V0IHJla3Q=")
atob("SG9wZSB5b3UgbGlrZSBSZWdleCE=")
atob("TG92ZSwgUGlsb3QuIDwzICA8MyA=")
```
```{node, echo = FALSE}
atob = a => Buffer.from(a, 'base64').toString('binary')
console.log(atob("MTVkIGhlcnJpbmcgZ2V0IHJla3Q="));
console.log(atob("SG9wZSB5b3UgbGlrZSBSZWdleCE="));
console.log(atob("TG92ZSwgUGlsb3QuIDwzICA8MyA="));
```
Niiiiice!

The final lines of code take these values, convert to binary, and print a `#` for 
each `1` (and a space otherwise)

```
for (const i of res) {
    const bin = BigInt(i).toString(2);
    let ln = "";
    for (const j of bin) ln += j == "0" ? " " : "#";
    console.log(ln);
}
```

If you do that, a message (slightly corrupted) appears. 

I decided to work backwards, since I was fairly sure what the 'right' solution
should be. Taking those lines (manually corrected), converting them all the way
back through the processing in reverse, I could see what the 'right' code should
be. 

The unicode line that produces what I think is the "right" solution is

```
subunit.push(btoa("ß]xëÏyÓm¼÷\x8DùÓ}ú"));
```

The characters are mainly close but not perfect, so maybe a `LOCALE` issue? Something 
to do with Linux (which I'm on) vs Windows?

The date line seems to be off by exactly 16 hours and 30 minutes which is
disturbingly likely to be a timezone issue. I'm at GMT+10:30 (Adelaide, South
Australia) at the moment. StackOverflow seems to have a lot of [angry
comments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9756120/how-do-i-get-a-utc-timestamp-in-javascript)
regarding whether or not this is an issue for `Date()`. I seem to be able to get
the "right" solution with

```
const datetime = new Date(1997, 7, 24, 16, 30);
```

With all that in place, it's time to run all of the code! If I do that, I get...

which is fitting, and thoroughly satisfying to finally produce.

I also ran this code (with my corrections, minus the `atob` and `btoa`
definitions) over on [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/) and it seems to give
the right solution, which makes me think perhaps it really is an error in the
code or how it was printed.

What an adventure! I learned a lot of javascript (how to run it with `node` and
in a browser for debugging), played with
[tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), and learned about
entering unicode. I'm sending this to Eric Yoon for comment and will update if I 
hear anything.

As a side note for this post, you'll notice that the code blocks are all nicely
rendered as usual - in this case they're the actual javascript from the easter
egg code. [{knitr}](https://yihui.org/knitr/) _does_ have a way to evaluate
javascript in code chunks with the `node` engine, but that essentially runs
`node -e 'CODE'` on each chunk independently, so you can't define a variable in
one chunk then reference it in another. That wasn't sufficient for this
exploration. I did find an (old)
[implementation](https://github.com/yihui/runr/pull/18) that uses
[{V8}](https://github.com/jeroen/V8) in Yihui's (already experimental)
[{runr}](https://github.com/yihui/runr), but it was written for a much older
version of [{knitr}](https://yihui.org/knitr/) and was out of date.

So, of course the thing to do was ~~just hardcode the output~~SHAVE A YAK AND UPDATE 
THE IMPLEMENTATION. If you'd like to have javascript code chunks in your Rmd, I've made 
[a pull request](https://github.com/stla/runr/pull/1/files) to that original implementation 
and have [my own fork](https://github.com/jonocarroll/runr).

It seems to work okay, with the exception that it doesn't pull in `Buffer` so my 
custom `atob` function doesn't work, and it doesn't have another. It's also going 
wrong in terms of the persistent context in that the `const` and `let` directives 
are being seen multiple times and it doesn't like that. Otherwise, variables persist
across chunks just fine - these chunks are fully live:

Define a variable `x`

```{V8}
x = 1 + 5;
```

Then continue the block

```{V8}
x + 12
```

So, that's working.

As always, leave a comment if you have one, or find me on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jonocarroll) (I'm much 
less on Twitter these days). If you have a correction or annotation to add to 
the code it's [here](https://github.com/jonocarroll/versionzero).
