<p>Another day, another interesting challenge.</p>
<p>I follow <a href="https://rud.is/b/">Bob Rudis’ (a.k.a. hrbrmstr’s) blog</a>, typically via <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a>, and <a href="https://rud.is/b/2016/03/10/some-light-image-processing-creation-with-r/">this post</a> caught my eye. Partly because I thought I knew of an existing way to do this. As usual, actually getting that to work took a little longer than I might have hoped, but I think the end result is pretty neat.</p>
<p>His post describes the process of writing an R function to take an image file, for example this one</p>
<p><img src="/post/2016-03-12-image-marginal-histograms_files/file10a566a2b4dc3.png" /></p>
<p>and producing a histogram along the sides of the number of pixels on a given row/column. This is what he created (a different image to the example, I believe)</p>

<p>Something funny is going on with the right-hand histogram; it doesn’t line up with the image.</p>
<p>Here’s my approach.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/JonoCarroll/7960dff5bf42e47423db.js"></script>
<p>It leverages the <code>png</code> package to extract the channels into a matrix, converts those to <code>x,y,z data.frame</code>s, takes the median value, plots that with <code>ggplot2</code>, then leverages <code>ggExtra::ggMarginal</code> to add the marginal histograms. Note that the <code>ggExtra</code> package has some bugs (it hasn’t been maintained in a while) in relation to more recent (possibly the dev branch) of <code>ggplot2</code>. I got it working on at least one of my machines. This is my result</p>

<p>I’ve had several uses for these types of marginal plots lately, so hopefully I can sort out the issues I’ve been getting in combination with <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
