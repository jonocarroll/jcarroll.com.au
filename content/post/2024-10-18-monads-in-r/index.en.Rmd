In this post I describe a useful programming pattern that I implemented, and 
hopefully provide a gentle introduction to the idea of monads.

The motivation for all of this was that I had a {dplyr} pipeline as part of a
{shiny} app that queries a database and I wanted to "record" what steps were in
that pipeline so that I could offer them as a way to 'reproduce' the query. Some
of the steps might be user-defined via the UI, so it was a little more
complicated than just a hardcoded query.

One quick-and-dirty solution that might come to mind would be to make a 
`with_logging()` function that takes an expression, writes a text-representation 
of it to a file or a global, then evaluates the expression. This would probably
work, but it means that every step of the pipeline needs to be wrapped in that.
Not the worst, but I had a feeling I knew of something more suitable. I've been 
trying to learn Haskell this year, and so far it's going sort of okay, but I'm 
taking a detour through Elm which has most of the same syntax but less of the 
hardcore 'maths' constructs.

Returning readers may have seen me use the term 'monadic' in the context of APL
where it means that a function 'takes one argument' (as compared to 'dyadic'
which takes two) and I believe this definition predates the mathematical one I'm
going to use for the rest of this post.

'Monad' is a term often best avoided in conversation, and is often described in
overly mathematical terms, the "meme" definition being the category theory
version which states

> "a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"

which is mostly true, but also unnecessary. Nonetheless, it's an extremely 
useful pattern that comes up a lot in functional programming.

[This blog post](https://www.adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
does a great job of walking through the more practical definition, and it has 
"translations" into several programming languages including [JavaScript](https://medium.com/@tzehsiang/javascript-functor-applicative-monads-in-pictures-b567c6415221#.rdwll124i) and [Python](https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Functors,-Applicatives,-And-Monads-In-Pictures).

Basically, `map` applies some function to some values. `flatMap` does the same, 
but first "reaches inside" a context to extract some inner values, and after 
applying the function, re-wraps the result in the original context.

One big advantage to this is that the 'purity' of the function remains; you 
always get the same output for the same input, but as well as that you can have 
some input/output operation be requested to be performed, which is how 'pure' 
languages still manage to communicate with the outside world and not just heat 
up the CPU for no reason.

The enlightening example for me is a `List` - if we have some values and want to 
apply some function to them, we can do that with, e.g.

```{r}
f <- function(x) x^2
Map(f, c(2, 4, 6))
```

and if we have a 'flat' list, this still works

```{r}
Map(f, list(2, 4, 6))
```

but what if we have an 'outer context' list?

```{r}
Map(f, list(c(2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)))
```

In this case, because `f` is vectorised, `Map` sends each vector to `f` and gets 
a result for each list. What if we have a list in the inner context?

```{r, error = TRUE}
Map(f, list(list(2, 3), list(4, 5, 6)))
```

This fails because `f(list(2, 3))` fails (it doesn't know how to deal with an 
argument which is a list).

Instead, we can use a version of 'map' that first reaches inside the outer 
`list` context, concatenates what's inside, applies the function, then re-wraps 
the result in a new, flat list

```{r}
fmap <- function(x, f) {
  list(f(unlist(x)))
}
fmap(list(list(2, 3), list(4, 5, 6)), f)
```

This is the essence of a monad - something that supports such a `fmap` operation
that performs the mapping inside the context (and potentially some other
operations, which we'll get to). There are various patterns which benefit from
such a context, and this vignette describes an implementation of several of
these via the [{monads}](https://jonocarroll.github.io/monads/index.html)
package.

The `fmap` operation is so common that it's typical to find it presented as an 
infix function, similar to how pipes work in R

```{r}
list(list(2, 3), list(4, 5, 6)) |> fmap(f)
```

and we can go one step further by defining a new pipe which is just a different 
syntax for this

```
x |> fmap(f)

x %>>=% f
```

This infix function borrows from Haskell's `>>=` (pronounced "bind") which is 
so fundamental that forms part of the language's logo

![The Haskell logo](images/haskell_logo.png){width=400px}

With all that in mind, here's how it looks in my (perhaps simplistic)
implementation which you can 
[get from GitHub here](https://github.com/jonocarroll/monads)

```{r}
library(monads)
```

![{monads} hex logo](images/logo.png)

Additionally, some toy helper functions are defined in this package for 
demonstrating application of functions, e.g.

```{r}
timestwo(4)

square(5)

add_n(3, 4)
```

## List

As per the example above, the `List` monad wraps values (which may be additional
`list`s) and when `flatMap`ed the results are 'flattened' into a single `List`.

```{r}
# identical to a regular Map
x <- listM(1, 2, 3) %>>=%
  timestwo()
x

# only possible with the flatMap approach
y <- listM(list(1, 2), list(3, 4, 5)) %>>=% 
  timestwo()
y
```

Note that while `x` and `y` print as regular lists, they remain `List` monads; 
a `print` method is defined which essentially extracts `value(x)`.

## Logger

As I alluded to earlier, additional operations can happen while the context is
unwrapped, including IO. What if I just kept a log of the operations and
appended each step to it? The wrapping context can include additional
components, and a stored 'log' of the expressions used at each step is entirely
possible.

All that is required is to wrap the value at the start of the pipeline in a
`Logger` context for which there is a constructor helper, `loggerM()`

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

result <- loggerM(mtcars) %>>=%
  filter(mpg > 10) %>>=%
  select(mpg, cyl, disp) %>>=%
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>>=%
  head()
```

This result is still a `Logger` instance, not a value. To extract the value from 
this we can use `value()`. To extract the log of each step, use `logger_log()` 
(to avoid conflict with `base::log`)

```{r}
value(result)

logger_log(result)
```

This works with any data value, so we could just as easily use an in-memory 
SQLite database (or external)

```{r}
mem <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
dplyr::copy_to(mem, mtcars)

res <- loggerM(mem) %>>=%
  tbl("mtcars") %>>=%
  filter(mpg > 10) %>>=%
  select(mpg, cyl, disp) %>>=%
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>>=%
  head()
```

Again, extracting the components from this

```{r}
value(res)

logger_log(res)
```

Since the log captures what operations were performed, we could re-run this 
expression, and a helper is available for that

```{r}
rerun(res)
```

Some similar functionality is present in the {magrittr} package which provides 
the 'classic' R pipe `%>%`; a 'functional sequence' starts with a `.` and 
similarly tracks which functions are to be applied to an arbitrary input once 
evaluated - in this way, this is similar to defining a new function.

```{r}
library(magrittr)

# define a functional sequence
fs <- . %>%
  tbl("mtcars") %>%
  select(cyl, mpg)

# evaluate the functional sequence with some input data
fs(mem)

# identify the function calls at each step of the pipeline
magrittr::functions(fs)
```

Since the functional sequence is unevaluated, errors can be present and not 
triggered

```{r, error = TRUE}
errfs <- . %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  stop("oops") %>%
  add_n(3)

x <- 1:10

errfs(x)
magrittr::functions(errfs)
```

In the monad context, steps which do raise an error nullify the value and a 
signifier is added to the log to prevent re-running the error

```{r}
resx <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  add_n(4)

value(resx)

logger_log(resx)

err <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  stop("oops") %>>=%
  add_n(3)

value(err)

logger_log(err)
```

Aside from an error destroying the value, returning a `NULL` result will also 
produce this effect

```{r}
nullify <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  ret_null() %>>=%
  add_n(7)

value(nullify)

logger_log(nullify)
```

One downside to the functional sequence approach is chaining these - since the 
first term must be `.`, that is always the first entry, and chaining multiple
sequences is not clean.

```{r}
a <- . %>% sqrt()
a

b <- . %>% a %>% add_n(1)
b

b(x)
```

Because the monad context is recreated at every step, chaining these is not a 
problem

```{r}
a <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt()

value(a)

logger_log(a)

b <- a %>>=%
  add_n(1)

value(b)

logger_log(b)
```

This achieves what I wanted in terms of 'recording' the steps of the pipeline, 
and it only requires wrapping the initial value and using a different pipe.

But there are other monads I could also implement... so I did.

## Timer

In addition to capturing the expressions in a log, the `Timer` monad also 
captures the evaluation timing for each step, storing these alongside the 
expressions themselves in a `data.frame`

```{r}
x <- timerM(5) %>>=%
  sleep_for(3) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  sleep_for(1.3)

value(x)

times(x)

y <- timerM(5) %>>=%
  sleep_for(2) %>>=%
  ret_null() %>>=%
  sleep_for(0.3)

value(y)

times(y)
```

## Maybe

In some languages it is preferrable to return _something_ rather than raising 
an error, particularly if you want to ensure that errors are handled. The 
`Maybe` pattern consists of either a `Nothing` (which is empty) or a `Just` 
containing some value; all functions applied to a `Maybe` will be one of these.

For testing the result, some helpers `is_nothing()` and `is_just()` are defined.

```{r}
x <- maybeM(9) %>>=% 
  sqrt() %>>=%
  timestwo()

value(x)

is_just(x)

is_nothing(x)

y <- maybeM(Nothing()) %>>=%
  sqrt()

value(y)

is_just(y)

is_nothing(y)

z <- maybeM(10) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  add_n(Nothing())

value(z)

is_just(z)

is_nothing(z)
```

For what is likely a much more robust implementation, see 
[{maybe}](https://armcn.github.io/maybe/).

## Result

Similar to a `Maybe`, a `Result` can contain either a successful `Ok` wrapped 
value or an `Err` wrapped message, but it will be one of these. This pattern 
resembles (and internally, uses) the `tryCatch()` approach where the evaluation 
will not fail, but requires testing what is produced to determine success, for 
which `is_ok()` and `is_err()` are defined.

```{r}
x <- resultM(9) %>>=% 
  sqrt() %>>=%
  timestwo()

value(x)

is_err(x)

is_ok(x)
```

When the evaluation fails, the error is reported, along with the value _prior_ 
to the error

```{r}
y <- resultM(9) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  ret_err("this threw an error")

value(y)

is_err(y)

is_ok(y)

z <- resultM(10) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  add_n("banana")

value(z)

is_err(z)

is_ok(z)
```

## Extensions

The `flatMap`/"bind" operator defined here as `%>>=%` is applicable to any monad
which has a `bind()` method defined. The monads defined in this package are all
`R6Class` objects exposing such a method of the form `m$bind(.call, .quo)` which 
expects a function and a quosure. You can add your own extensions to these by 
defining such a class (and probably a constructor helper and a `print()` method)

```{r}
# a Reporter monad which reports unpiped function calls
Reporter <- R6::R6Class(
  c("ReporterMonad"),
  public = list(
    value = NULL,
    initialize = function(value) {
      if (rlang::is_quosure(value)) {
        self$value <- rlang::eval_tidy(value)
      } else {
        self$value <- value
      }
    },
    bind = function(f, expr) {
      ## 'undo' the pipe and inject the lhs as an argument
      result <- unlist(lapply(unlist(self$value), f))
      args <- as.list(c(self$value, rlang::call_args(expr)))
      fnew <- rlang::call2(rlang::call_name(expr), !!!args)
      cat(" ** Calculating:", rlang::quo_text(fnew), "=", result, "\n")
      Reporter$new(result)
    }
  )
)

reporterM <- function(value) {
  v <- rlang::enquo(value)
  Reporter$new(v)
}

print.Reporter <- function(x, ...) {
  print(value(x))
}

x <- reporterM(17) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  square() %>>=% 
  add_n(2) %>>=%
  `/`(8)

value(x)
```

This is just a toy example; attempting to `cat()` a `data.frame` result would 
not go well.

## Other Monads

There are other patterns that I haven't implemented. One that would have been 
interesting is `Promise` - I had a 'mind-blown' moment reading 
[this post about some Roc syntax](https://rtfeldman.com/imperative-clothing) 
with the throw-away line 

> Tasks can be chained together using the `Task.await` function, similarly to
how JavaScript Promises can be chained together using a Promise's `then()`
method. (You might also know functions in other languages similar to
`Task.await` which go by names like `andThen`, `flatMap`, or `bind`.)

because I had never made the connection between monads and async/await, but it's
a lot clearer now. I did try implementing `Promise` in {monads} using {future} 
but I couldn't quite get the unevaluated promise object to pipe correctly.

## Prior Art

There are a handful of existing implementations, most of which are more fleshed 
out than mine. 

- [{monads}](https://github.com/hadley/monads) - a sketched-out implementation 
that relies on dispatch for `flatMap` operations. I'm using the same name as 
this package, but that one hasn't been touched in quite a while.

- [{rmonad}](https://github.com/arendsee/rmonad) - archived on CRAN, but offers 
a sophisticated 'funnel' mechanism and various ways to capture steps of a pipeline.

- [{maybe}](https://armcn.github.io/maybe/) - a more detailed implementation of 
`Maybe`.

- [{chronicler}](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/chronicler/) - a way to 
post-process the result at each step and capture information, such as the 
runtime (see `Timer`) or dimensions. Requires an explicit `bind()` at each step.
[Associated blog post](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2022-04-11-monads/).

I also found [this post](https://kupac.gitlab.io/biofunctor/2019/05/25/maybe-monad-in-r/) 
about implementing a `Maybe` monad, and [this one](https://scscript.blogspot.com/2011/03/monads-in-r-sapply-and-foreach.html?m=1) 
comparing the {foreach} package's `%do%` to Haskell.

I'm somewhat surprised that in all of the above examples, none seem to use the 
Haskell 'bind' format of a pipe (`>>=` or as a valid R infix special, `%>>=%`) 
but at least I'm not stepping on other package's toes there. One particular 
benefit of this one is that by deleting the two outermost characters inside the 
special you get the {magrittr} pipe `%>%`.

If nothing else, I found it really useful to go through the process of defining 
these myself - I learned a lot about {R6} classes and quosures in the process, 
too.

My package comes with no guarantees - it works for the examples I've tried, but 
it's possible (if not likely) that I've not thought of all the edge cases. I've 
certainly relied on R's vectorisation (rather than explicitly re-mapping 
individual values) and my quosure skills are somewhat underdeveloped.

If you do [take it for a spin](https://github.com/jonocarroll/monads) I'd love
to hear your thoughts on it. As always, I can be found on
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jonocarroll) and the comment section below.
