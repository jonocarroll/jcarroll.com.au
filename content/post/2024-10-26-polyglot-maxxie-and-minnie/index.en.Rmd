intro

<!--more-->

For an upcoming APL'ers meetup the challenge was set as posed at the end of 
[in this post](https://ericnormand.me/issues/468), namely

**Maxxie and Minnie**

> The maxxie of a number n is the largest number you can achieve by swapping two
of its digits (in decimal) (or choosing not to swap if it is already the largest
possible). The minnie is the smallest with one swap (though you can't swap a
zero digit into the most significant position).
> 
> Your task is to write a function that takes an integer and returns a tuple of
the maxxie and minnie.
> 
> Notes
> 
> - Swap any two decimal digits
> - No leading zeroes
> - Don't swap if you can't make it bigger/smaller

with the example solutions given in Clojure 

```clojure
(swapmaxmin 213) ;=> [312, 123]
(swapmaxmin 12345) ;=> [52341, 12345] ;; the number was already the smallest
(swapmaxmin 100) ;=> [100, 100] ;; no swap possible because of zeroes
```

This seems like fun - and I wanted to see how solutions might look across some 
of the different languages I know (including an APL, for the sake of the upcoming 
meetup).

I ended up using R, (Dyalog) APL, Julia, Haskell, Python, and Rust, and I'll add
in any others shared with me. The site linked above collected Clojure solutions
in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ericnormand/4ca47720a954307739aaeb12682de98a).

The common approach I used in all of these cases was:

- split the number into a vector of digits
- generate all possible combinations of indices to be swapped
- apply a swap function to perform all of those swaps
- append the unswapped vector, if not already included
- filter out any vectors which start with a `0`
- recombine each vector into a single number
- return the maximum and minimum numbers

Here are my solutions in each language; it's not so much for side-by-side
comparison, but you can switch between the different ones. The full set of files
is [here](https://github.com/jonocarroll/maxxieminnie) if you're interested.

* R<br><img src="images/r.png" height="40px">

  I'm most familiar with R, so I like to start there. I created a `swap` 
  function that swaps a vector at some indices, along with some helpers 
  so that I could use `pmap_int()` really cleanly.

  ```r
  swap <- function(x, y, v) {
     xx <- v[x]
     yy <- v[y]
     v[x] <- yy
     v[y] <- xx
     v
  }

  chr_swap <- function(x, y, v) {
     paste0(swap(x, y, v), collapse = "")
  }

  toInt_swap <- function(x, y, v) {
     as.integer(chr_swap(x, y, v))
  }

  maxmin <- function(num) {
    chars <- strsplit(as.character(num), "")[[1]]
    n <- nchar(num)
    s <- seq_len(n)
    opts <- expand.grid(x = s, y = s)
    opts$v <- list(chars)
    vals <- purrr::pmap_int(opts, toInt_swap)
    keeps <- vals[nchar(vals) == n]
    c(max(keeps), min(keeps))
  }
  
  maxmin(213)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  [1] 312 123  
  ```
  
  ```r
  maxmin(12345)  
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  [1] 52341 12345  
  ```
  
  ```r
  maxmin(100)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  [1] 100 100  
  ```
  
  ```r
  maxmin(11321)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  [1] 31121 11123 
  ```

   The `expand.grid()` does create some redundant combinations, but these fall
   out naturally so I didn't bother filtering them out. Also, since this
   includes no-op swaps (e.g. swapping index `2` and `2`) it already contains
   the original vector. Rather than filtering to the vectors of integers _not_
   starting with 0, I filtered to those which contain the right number of digits
   after converting back to integer, which is equivalent.
   
   Try pasting the code into the 
   [{webr} online editor here](https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/); I'm not sure 
   if it's possible to link to an existing state, but when it asks if you want 
   to install {purrr} to the interface, respond that you do.

* APL<br><img src="images/apl.png" height="40px">

  In Dyalog APL it's easier to define a swap function; the `@` operator takes a
  function (reverse) so `s` here performs a swap. The outer product is super 
  handy for finding all the combinations of `x` and `y`: `x ∘., y`.

  ```apl
  maxmin←{
    ⎕IO←1  ⍝ so that x[1] is subset not x[0]
    n←⍎¨⍕⍵  ⍝ convert int to vec 
    s←{⌽@⍵⊢⍺}  ⍝ swap two elements
    swaps←{n s ⍵}  ⍝ apply swaps to a vec n
    opts←,(⍳≢n)∘.,⍳≢n ⍝ combinations of 1..n
    new←swaps¨opts  ⍝ perform the swaps
    keep←(~0=⊃¨new)/new  ⍝ filter out values starting with 0
    (⌈/,⌊/)10⊥¨keep  ⍝ max and min of ints
}

       maxmin 213 
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  312 123
  ```
    
  ```apl
       maxmin 12345 
  ```
    
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  52341 12345
  ```
  
  ```apl
       maxmin 100 
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  100 100
  ```
  
  ```apl
       maxmin 11321
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  31121 11123
  ```
  
  I'm quite pleased with this solution; performing a `map` is as simple as 
  using each (`¨`) and performing both `max` and `min` concatenated together 
  with a fork (`(⌈/,⌊/)`) is just so aesthetic. Conversion from a vector of 
  numbers to a single number uses a base-10 decode (`10⊥`) which is how one 
  might need to do that in other languages, but with a loop.
  
  If I was to take some liberties with what one calls a 'line', I could say 
  that this is a 1-line solution
  
  ```apl
  maxmin←{⎕IO←1 ⋄ n←⍎¨⍕⍵ ⋄ s←{⌽@⍵⊢⍺} ⋄ swaps←{n s ⍵} ⋄ opts←,(⍳≢n)∘.,⍳≢n ⋄ new←swaps¨opts ⋄ keep←(~0=⊃¨new)/new ⋄ (⌈/,⌊/)10⊥¨keep }
  ```

* Julia<br><img src="images/julia.png" height="40px">

  In Julia the `swap` function can use destructuring which is nice, but since 
  the language uses pass-by-reference semantics, I need to make a copy of the 
  vector being swapped, otherwise I'll just keep swapping it over and over. 
  Note: [this recent post of mine](https://jcarroll.com.au/2024/09/25/in-place-modifications/).

  ```julia
  using Combinatorics
  
  function swap(x, i, j)
    y = copy(x)
    y[i], y[j] = y[j], y[i]
    y
  end

  function maxmin(x)
      nvec = parse.(Int64, split(string(x), ""))
      opts = collect(combinations(1:length(nvec), 2))
      new = [[nvec]; map(x -> swap(nvec, x...), opts)]
      keep = filter(x -> x[1] != 0, new)
      vals = parse.(Int64, join.(keep))
      (maximum(vals), minimum(vals))
  end

  maxmin(213)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (312, 123)
  ```
  
  ```julia
  maxmin(12345)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (52341, 12345)  
  ```
  
  ```julia
  maxmin(100)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (100, 100)  
  ```
  
  ```julia
  maxmin(11321)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (31121, 11123)    
  ```

  The part I probably had the most trouble with here was concatenating together 
  the original vector with its swapped versions; it looks clean now, but 
  figuring out how to get those all into the same vector-of-vectors took me a 
  while.
  
  The splatting of `opts` variants in the `map` was nice; no need to define the 
  swap in terms of a tuple. Overall, this is a very clean solution, in my 
  opinion - Julia really does make for a lovely language.

* Haskell<br><img src="images/haskell.png" height="40px">

  Continuing my Haskell-learning journey, I figured it would be best to have a 
  go at this. As a heavily functional language, one doesn't do a lot of 
  defining of variables, instead one writes a lot of functions which will pass 
  data around. This makes it a bit tricky for testing, but I got there 
  eventually. I did have to borrow the `swapElts` function, and `nub` was a new 
  one for me (essentially `unique()`).

  ```haskell
  import Data.List
  import Data.Digits

  uniq_pairs l = nub [(x,y) | x <- l, y <- l, x < y]
  opts n = uniq_pairs [0..n-1]
  -- https://gist.github.com/ijt/2010183
  swapElts i j ls = [get k x | (k, x) <- zip [0..length ls - 1] ls]
      where get k x | k == i = ls !! j
                    | k == j = ls !! i
                    | otherwise = x
  doswap t v = swapElts (fst t) (snd t) v
  newlist v = v : map (\x ->  doswap x v) (opts (length v))
  keep v = filter (\x -> (head x /= 0)) (newlist v)
  maxmin n = (maximum(x), minimum(x)) where 
    x = map (unDigits 10) (keep (digits 10 n))

  maxmin 213
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (312,123)
  ```

  ```haskell
  maxmin 12345
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}  
  (52341,12345)
  ```
  
  ```haskell
  maxmin 100
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (100,100)
  ```

  ```haskell
  maxmin 11321
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (31121,11123)
  ```

  The `Data.Digits` package was very helpful here - having `digits` and 
  `unDigits`, though if I was going to use these more I would have curried 
  the required base 10 into something like `digits10` and `unDigits10`.
  
  There are likely improvements to be made here, and I'm interested in any you
  can spot!

* Python<br><img src="images/python.png" height="40px">

  "Everyone" uses it, so I gotta learn it... is what I keep telling myself. I'm
  no stranger to the quirks of different languages, but every time I try 
  to do something functional in python I end up angry that the print method for 
  generators shows the memory address instead of, say, the first few elements. 
  Printing a value and seeing `<map at 0x7fb928d4a2c0>` gets me every. single.
  time. Yes, yes, `list(value)` "collects" it, but grrr...
  
  Python has the destructuring syntax which is nice in the `swap` function, but 
  again it's pass-by-reference so I need to make a copy first.

  ```python
  import itertools

  def swap(x, t):
      y = x.copy()
      i, j = t
      y[i], y[j] = y[j], y[i]
      return y

  def minmax(num): 
      nums = [int(i) for i in str(num)]
      opts = itertools.combinations(range(len(nums)), 2)
      new = map(lambda x: swap(nums, x), list(opts))
      keeps = list(filter(lambda x: x[0] != 0, new))
      keeps.append(nums)
      vals = list(map(lambda x: int(''.join(map(str, x))), keeps))
      return (max(vals), min(vals))

  minmax(213)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (312, 123)
  ```
  
  ```python
  minmax(12345)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (52341, 12345)
  ```
  
  ```python
  minmax(100)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (100, 100)
  ```
  
  ```python
  minmax(11321)
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (31121, 11123)
  ```

  Aside from my grumbles while writing it, the solution is still pretty clean.
  The calls to `list()` interspersed throughout might be avoidable, but the 
  need to do that while developing at least slowed me down.

* Rust<br><img src="images/rust.png" height="40px">

  I almost didn't do a Rust solution because I thought I'd done enough. It 
  ended up being the most complicated, though - I'm not sure if that's because 
  of me, or Rust. 

  ```rust
  use itertools::Itertools;

  fn swap(v: Vec<u32>, t1: usize, t2: usize) -> Vec<u32> {
      let mut vv = v;
      let tmp1 = vv[t1];
      let tmp2 = vv[t2];
      vv[t1] = tmp2;
      vv[t2] = tmp1;
      return vv;
  }

  fn maxmin(num: u32) -> (u32, u32) {
      let numc = num.to_string();
      let n = numc.len();
      let numv: Vec<u32> = numc
          .to_string()
          .chars()
          .map(|c| c.to_digit(10).unwrap())
          .collect();
      let mut opts = Vec::new();
      for (a, b) in (0..n).tuple_combinations() {
          opts.push((a, b));
      }
      let mut new: Vec<Vec<u32>> = Vec::new();
      new.push(numv.clone());
      for o in opts {
          new.push(swap(numv.clone(), o.0, o.1));
      }
      let keeps: Vec<Vec<u32>> = new.into_iter().filter(|x| x[0] != 0).collect();
      let mut vals = Vec::new();
      for v in keeps {
          let tmp: u32 = v
              .clone()
              .into_iter()
              .map(|x| x.to_string())
              .collect::<String>()
              .parse()
              .unwrap();
          vals.push(tmp);
      }
      let min = *vals.iter().min().unwrap();
      let max = *vals.iter().max().unwrap();
      (max, min)
  }

  fn main() {
      println!("{:?}", maxmin(213));
      println!("{:?}", maxmin(12345));
      println!("{:?}", maxmin(100));
      println!("{:?}", maxmin(11321))
  }
  ```
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "bg-success"}
  (312, 123)
  (52341, 12345)
  (100, 100)
  (31121, 11123)
  ```

  This solution reminded me why I like working with array (or 
  at least vector-supporting) languages; not needing to explicitly loop over 
  every element of a vector to do something. I had to write a lot of `push()`
  loops to move data around. `max()` doesn't work on a vector (in the sense of
  finding the maximum of n elements); it works that way on an iterator, and may 
  fail, hence the longer `min` and `max` lines.
  
  Having to `clone()` various values explicitly because they can't be re-used 
  was a bit annoying, but I understand _why_ it complains about those.
  
  This took longer than I would have liked, but of course I learned more by 
  doing it.

* J<br><img src="images/j.png" height="40px">

  At the APL meetup we discussed one partial J solution which used a slightly 
  different approach to the 'swap' algorithm. I'm not sure that there _is_ a 
  way in J that's as elegant as the APL solution, but I'd be interested if 
  there is.

  [this](https://gist.github.com/justuswilhelm/e5b5898d12f9ddb69d5ab85c8e8ec32c) 
  solution, the essence of which is

  ```j

  There's a lot I want to learn about J, so I'll be digging through this 
  solution myself.

## Summary

I was most pleased with the APL solution; it does what it says on the box 
without ambiguity because it's constructed entirely from primitives (or utility
functions defined in terms of those). The Julia solution also feels very clean, 
while the Haskell solution, defined entirely from functions, nicely demonstrates 
the functional principle.

I found it to be an interesting example of where pass-by-reference is _not_ so 
helpful. For packaged Julia functions that distinction is made clear with the 
`!` suffix to denote mutating functions, and it's common to write both a 
mutating and non-mutating version wherever possible.

Writing these taught me more and more about using each of these languages, and 
I'm of the opinion that just reading solutions is no substitute for getting your 
hands dirty in some actual code.
